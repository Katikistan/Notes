## Exercises 
### Monday
#### 5.1
In this exercise we look at memory locality properties of matrix computation. The following code is written in C, where elements within the same row are stored contiguously. Assume each word is a 32-bit integer.
```
for (I=0; I<8; I++) 
	for (J=0; J<8000; J++) 
		A[I][J]=B[I][0]+A[J][I];
```
#### 5.1.1
How many 32-bit integers can be stored in a 16 - byte cache block?

den kan holde 8 * 16
128/32 = 4, den kan holde 4 32 bit ints
#### 5.1.2
Which variable references exhibit temporal locality?

**Vi tilgår `i` adressen flere gange, den har samme adresse men skifter værdi
Vi tilgår `j` adressen flere gange, den har samme adresse men skifter værdi
B\[i\]\[0\] tilgår vi 8000 gange hver gang vi går igennem det inderste loop**
#### 5.1.3
Which variable references exhibit spatial locality? Locality is affected by both the reference order and data layout. The same computation can also be written below in Matlab, which differs from C in that it stores matrix elements within the same column contiguously in memory.

```
for I=1:8 
	for J=1:8000 
		A(I,J)=B(I,0)+A(J,I); 
	end 
end
```

A(I,J)
#### 5.1.4
Which variable references exhibit temporal locality
I J og B(I,J)
#### 5.1.5
Which variable references exhibit spatial locality?
A(J,I)
#### 5.1.6
How many 16-byte cache blocks are needed to store all 32-bit matrix elements being referenced using Matlab’s matrix storage? How many using C’s matrix storage? (Assume each row contains more than one element.)
#### 5.2
Caches are important to providing a high-performance memory hierarchy to processors. Below is a list of 32-bit memory address references, given as word addresses. 

0x03, 0xb4, 0x2b, 0x02, 0xbf, 0x58, 0xbe, 0x0e, 0xb5, 0x2c, 0xba, 0xfd
#### 5.2.1

 
For each of these references, identify the binary word address, the tag, and the index given a direct-mapped cache with 16 one-word blocks. Also list whether each reference is a hit or a miss, assuming the cache is initially empty

16 blocks, der skal bruges 4 bits til at repræsenter 16. 
4 bit kan rep 16 sets 

one word er 4 bits, der skal bruges 2 bits til at repræsenter 4.

| tag | set  | offset | hit or miss |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| 00  | 0000 | 11     | miss        |
| 10  | 1101 | 00     | miss        |
| 00  | 1010 | 11     | miss        |
| 00  | 0000 | 10     | hit         |
| 10  | 1111 | 11     | miss            |
| 01  | 0110 | 00     | miss        |
| 10  | 1111 | 10     |  hit           |
| 00  | 0011 | 10     |  miss           |
| 10  | 1101 | 01     |  hit           |
| 00  | 1011 | 00     |  miss           |
| 10  | 1110 | 10     | miss            |
| 11  | 1111 | 01     |    miss         |
	
#### 5.2.2
For each of these references, identify the binary word address, the tag, the index, and the offset given a direct mapped cache with two-word blocks and a total size of eight blocks. Also list if each reference is a hit or a miss, assuming the cache is initially empty.

sets 8 kan rep med 3 bits
2 words er 8 bytes og kan derfor rep med 3 bits. derfor er offset 3

| tag | set  | offset | hit or miss |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| 00  | 000 | 011     | miss        |
| 10  | 110 | 100     | miss        |
| 00  | 101 | 011     | miss        |
| 00  | 000 | 010     | hit         |
| 10  | 111 | 111     | miss            |
| 01  | 011 | 000     | miss        |
| 10  | 111 | 110     |  hit           |
| 00  | 001 | 110     |  miss           |
| 10  | 1101 | 101     |  hit           |
| 00  | 101 | 100     |  hit           |
| 10  | 111 | 010     | hit            |
| 11  | 111 | 101     |    miss         |
#### 5.2.3
You are asked to optimize a cache design for the given references. There are three direct-mapped cache designs possible, all with a total of eight words of data: 
C1 has 1-word blocks, 
C2 has 2-word blocks, and 
C3 has 4-word blocks.

| tag | set  | offset | hit or miss |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| 00  | 00 | 0011     | miss        |
| 10  | 11 | 0100     | miss        |
| 00  | 10 | 1011     | miss        |
| 00  | 00 | 0010     | hit         |
| 10  | 11 | 1111     | hit            |
| 01  | 01 | 1000     | miss        |
| 10  | 11 | 1110     |  hit           |
| 00  | 00 | 1110     |  hit           |
| 10  | 11 | 0101     |  hit           |
| 00  | 10 | 1100     |  hit           |
| 10  | 11 | 1010     | hit            |
| 11  | 11 | 1101     |    miss         |
den har færrest misses
#### 5.5
For a direct-mapped cache design with a 32-bit address, the following bits of the address are used to access the cache.

| Tag | Index | Offset |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
|   63–10  |   9-5    | 4-0       |
What is the cache block size (in words): 5 bits, 2^5 = 32 bits * 8 words = 256
32 sets



How many blocks does the cache have? 32 blocks

What is the ratio between total bits required for such a cache implementation over the data storage bits? Beginning from power on, the following byte-addressed cache references are recorded.
