## Exercises 
### Monday
#### 2.1
variables f, g, and h, have already been placed in registers x5, x6, and x7 respectively. Use a minimal number of RISC-V assembly instructions. 
f = g + (h − 5);
```asm
addi x5, x7, 5
add x5, x5, x6
```
#### 2.2
Write a single C statement that corresponds to the two RISC-V assembly instructions below. 
add f, g, h 
add f, i, f
```C
f = g + h + i
```
#### 2.3
For the following C statement, write the corresponding RISC-V assembly code. Assume that the variables f, g, h, i, and j are assigned to registers x5, x6, x7, x28, and x29, respectively. Assume that the base address of the arrays A and B are in registers x10 and x11, respectively. B[8] = A[i−j];
```
sub x5, x28, x29
add x5, x5, x10  
lb x5, 0(x5) 
sb x5, 8(x11)
```
#### 2.4
what is the corresponding C statement? Assume that the variables f, g, h, i, and j are assigned to registers x5, x6, x7, x28, and x29, respectively. Assume that the base address of the arrays A and B are in registers x10 and x11, respectively.
```
slli  x30, x5,  2   # x30 = f * 4
add   x30, x10, x30 # x30 = &A[f]
slli  x31, x6,  2   # x31 = g * 4
add   x31, x11, x31 # x31 = &B[g]
lw    x5, 0(x30)    # f = A[f]

addi x12, x30, 4 # &A[f] + 4 
lw   x30, 0(x12) # x30 = A[f + 1] 
add  x30, x30, x5 # x30 = A[f + 1] + A[f]
sw   x30, 0(x31) # B[g] =  A[f + 1] + A[f]
```
```
B[g] = A[f + 1] + A[f]
```
#### 2.5
Show how the value 0xabcdef12 would be arranged in memory of a little-endian and a big-endian machine. Assume the data are stored starting at address 0 and that the word size is 4 bytes
**little Endian**

| adresse | Byte |
| ------- | ---- |
| 0       | 12  |
| 1       |   ef   |
| 2       |     cd |
| 3        |     ab |

**Big endian**

| adresse | Byte |
| ------- | ---- |
| 0       | ab   |
| 1       | cd   |
| 2       | ef   |
| 3       | 12   |

#### 2.6
Translate 0xabcdef12 into decimal.
$2*16^0+16^1+15*16^2+14*16^3+14*16^4+13*16^5+12*16^6+11*16^7+10*16^8=2882400018$
#### 2.24.1
Assume that the register x6 is initialized to the 362 value 10. What is the final value in register x5 assuming the x5 is initially zero?
```
LOOP: beqx6, x0, DONE 
addi x6, x6, -1 
addi x5, x5, 2 
jalx0, LOOP 
DONE:
```
den adderer 2 10 gange: essentially 2 * 10 
#### 2.24.2
For the loop above, write the equivalent C code. Assume that the registers x5 and x6 are integers acc and i, respectively.
```C
while (i != 0) {
	i = i - 1;
	acc = acc + 2;
}	
```
#### 2.24.3
For the loop written in RISC-V assembly above, assume that the register x6 is initialized to the value N. How many RISC-V instructions are executed

**vi `beq` 1 gang hver iteration `addi` 2 gange, `jal` 1 gang
Så vi kører N * 4 iterationer  + 1 fordi der er en sidste instruktion bliver executed når x6 = x0**
#### 2.24.4
For the loop written in RISC-V assembly above, replace the instruction “beq x6, x0, DONE” with the instruction “blt x6, x0, DONE” and write the equivalent C code.
```
LOOP: bltx6, x0, DONE 
addi x6, x6, -1 
addi x5, x5, 2 
jalx0, LOOP 
DONE:
```
```C
while (i >= 0) {
	i = i - 1;
	acc = acc + 2;
}
```
#### 2.25
Translate the following C code to RISC-V assembly code. Use a minimum number of instructions. Assume that the values of a, b, i, and j are in registers x5, x6, x7, and x29, respectively. Also, assume that register x10 holds the base address of the array D.
```C
for(i=0; i< a; i++)
	for(j=0;  j < b; j++)
		D[4 * j] = i + j
```
```
LOOP0:
beq x7, x5, DONE0
	addi x7, x7, 1 # i = i + 1 
	jal x0, LOOP1 # go into inner loop
LOOP1:
beq x29, x6 LOOP0
	slli x28, x29, 2 # x28 = 4*j
	add x30, x10, x28 # x30 = D[4 * j]
	add x31, x7, x29 # x31 = i + j
	sw x31, 0(x30) #  D[4 * j] = i + j
	addi x7, x7, 1 # j = j + 1 
DONE0:
