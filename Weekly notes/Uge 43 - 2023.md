a) we see that there are 2mbps available and 1 user uses 1 mbps therefore 2 users will use 2mbps and that is all that can be supported
b) if we used packet switching there will be space for 2 users, when there are only 2 users the queue is emptied before new stuff is added therefore it newer becomes full and therefore there are no queue time, but when there are 3 users the queue gets filled fasted than it's emptied leading to some packets having to wait to be inserted in the queue. 
c) each user transmits only 20 percent of the time - therefore 0.2 is the probability
d) binomial distrubution: n = 3, r = 3, p = 0.2 fordi 20%, 
K_n,r = 3/3 = 1  
(1-p)^(n-r)= 1-p^0= 1
derfor p^r, som er 0.2^3=0.008 eller 0.8%.

Beacuse they avoid having to pay the provider higher in the hierarchy each time they want to access some information.

Her har vi fire ledninger der løber fra hver switch

**What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress at any one time in this network?**

der kan være 4 per switch og der er fire switches 4 x 4 = 16

**Suppose that all connections are between switches A and C. What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress?**

Der kan løbe 4 igennem A->C og 4 gennem A-> B -> D -> C
Derfor 4 + 4 = 8

**Suppose we want to make four connections between switches A and C, and another four connections between switches B and D. Can we  route these calls through the four links to accommodate all eight connections?**
Ja hvis vi bruger 2 links til hver forbindelse så 2 til A and C og 2 til B og D.
