# 30 Introduction to Design
## What is design?
design as creation, design as problemsolving, design as knowledge production, and design as transformation.

**Improving** Design can improve the usability, accessibility, and experience of computing systems.

**Creating** Design can create entirely new opportunities for people to use computing systems in contexts of ways not possible before. 
**Informing** Design is the study of what is possible. By showing alternatives to status quo, design informs decisions and create needs for change. 

**Producing knowledge** Design not only applies HCI knowledge, but is necessary to evolve such knowledge. Knowledge about interaction can be advanced by testing ideas in interactive prototypes and designs.
### Interaction Design
HCI has two distinct characteristics: its focus on interactive technology and its humancenteredness. First, in HCI, design focuses on interactive technology. The area closest to HCI is called interaction design.

To sum up, a central goal in interaction design is to create new potential for computing

### What does user-centered in user-centered design mean?
Artefacts are not produced for the sake of profit, algorithmic efficiency, artistic pleasure, but with the goal of making a difference in the lifeworld of other people.

**User focus** Understanding and serving the user’s goals, tasks, and needs is the primary goal of design. 

**User involvement** Representative users are actively engaged throughout. The different processes we discuss in this chapter differ in how this is achieved. 

**Iterative and incremental development** Iteration is necessary because it is practically impossible to know the specifics of what needs to be designed from the outset. 

**Prototyping** Early and continuous prototyping, which helps evaluate ideas before converging to a particular solution prematurely. 

**Evaluation in context** Prototypes should be evaluated with real users in real contexts whenever possible. 

**Holistic design** Understanding that all designed aspects of a product, from its advertisements to social media presence and manuals, affect its use. 

**Process customization** Avoiding a rigid process and ensuring continuous reflection and evolution of the process.
## Generating creative ideas
### Problem-solving
Problem solving refers to attempts to create “a course of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones”
### Creative ideation
Design is a creative activity, the objective of which is to produce a novel and relevant artefact or service. Boden defined three types of creative thinking

**Combinatorial creativity** Identifying a combination of decisions within a given conceptual space when it was previously believed that such a solution would be unlikely. Dvorak Simplified Keyboard was revolutionary at its time because it sought to optimize the assignment of letters for typing performance and ergonomics.

**Exploratory creativity** Finding new a conceptual approach that helps identifying an idea that was earlier considered impossible, or simply not considered at all.

**Transformatory creativity** Transforming or replacing a conceptual space, thus allowing an entirely new perspective to think about a problem space.
### Design thinking
design thinking offers methods for convergent and divergent thinking

In divergent thinking, the goal is to chart the options that are available, while in convergent thinking, the goal is to narrow down the number of options to the most promising one

## Practicing design
Instead, it occurs as the result of some deliberated application of techniques and practices.
### The Reflective Practitioner
Professional designers reflect about their own creations and study others. This sort of reflection is critical for the ability to understand a broader context of design
### Practices of Participation
Participatory design is a name used jointly for design processes that involve stakeholders, especially end-users, not only via user research and evaluation, but at the heart of the process in the generation of design ideas. The method originates from Scandinavia, where it was developed in the 1970s to increase productivity and democratize design at workplaces and the industry. Workshops are commonly used as a way to facilitate expert involvement
## What should be designed?
A key question in human-centered design is not what can be designed but what should be designed.
## Summary
• Design reaches beyond the user interface and concerns graphics, concepts, services, and so on. 

• Design is about changing users’ practices and experiences via novel artefacts. In contrast, natural sciences seeks to obtain knowledge about the world but does not intend to change it. 

• Designers’ work is organized into processes that involve design techniques and practices. These aim to ensure high quality and a high likelihood of success without compromising creativity. 

• Design is the nexus of human-centered design where user research, evaluation, and engineering come together. It not just about the creation of ideas and artefacts, it produces knowledge about possibilities for innovation and research
# 31 Design Cognition
## Cognitive Processes in Design
Design cognition entails four thought processes,
![Uploading file...2ubgt]()

**Convergent thinking** Attempts to improve existing solutions iteratively by making local adjustments rather than by considering more radical novel solutions. 

**Divergent thinking** Attempts to identify distant—novel—solutions, thus diverging from the solution at hand. This involves activities, such as seeking inspiration from related materials. It can also draw from art or nature.  Sketching can also be used as a method for divergent thinking. 

**Reconceptualizing problems** Rethinking defining elements of a design problem: what are the relevant objectives, constraints, viewpoints etc? This can be achieved via analogues, metaphors, and reframings. 

**Reorganizing design situations** Designers also facilitate cognition by organizing their external circumstances. for example by the means of sketching, collaborative tools, and design portfolios. 
### General characteristics
By iteration, known solutions and new ideas are combined into several protosolutions (e.g., sketches) that then can be evaluated in some way.

designers face a strategic decision: they need to decide when to stop diverging (exploring) and shift to convergent thinking (exploiting).

### Design fixation
design fixation means being mentally locked to a particular solution and being unable to generate alternatives

We tend to stick to conveniently available solutions that we are familiar with.

So can one break fixation? Successful designers actively create new reference points
## Generating solutions
A well-defined design task has the following constituents:

**Design decisions** The open decisions that must be decided toward a design. 

**Design space** The set of all designs to be considered, as implied by any currently open design decisions. 

**Objectives** Properties that an acceptable design must possess, such as those related to ease of use, cognitive workload, or manufacturing costs. 

**Constraints** Hard limitations and requirements on the design. For example, in the menu design task we can insist that all commands must be placed within the menu. Budgets and software pose typical constraints in interaction design.
### Generating creative ideas
quantity drives quality. In practice, designers alternate between generation, evaluation, and reflection: 

1. Generate as many low-fidelity candidates as possible, even up to 100 sketches per hour. Suspend criticism to a later stage.  (Divergent)
2. Select candidates by evaluating them against defined objectives. (Convergent)
3. Reflect on progress and try to find alternative approaches.  (Convergent) 
4. If needed, refine the problem description.   (Convergent)
5. Iterate until satisfied. (Divergent)
### Ideation methods
#### Brainstorming
Most brainstorming methods subscribe to a few shared principles:
• Postpone criticism: By withholding criticism, the team can avoid throttling the generative process. 
• Divergence: Encourage wild, diverse ideas. 
• Quantity: Try to produce as many ideas as possible. 
• Accumulation of knowledge: It is acceptable and encouraged to build on proposed ideas and known solutions. 
• Equal significance: Every participant and every idea is equally valuable.
### Refining problem descriptions
“innovate a new style to interact” 

What exactly is the meaning of ’new’ here, or ’style’? It is not meaningful to talk about problem solving if the design task is not properly defined. An ill-defined problem has no clear objectives, or has too many constraints.
 
focus on properly defined objectives and constraints with goal refinement: redefine the problem and reinterpret it
## Sketching
Sketching is an idea generation method that assumed a special role in particular in interaction design

it shares many characteristics with brainstorming. Like in brainstorming, ideation in sketching should be done quickly, focusing on quantity over quantity. Frimærkeskitser. 

Designers sketch numerous, up to hundreds, of sketches in a project. They keep working on several ideas in parallel, going back and forth between different levels of detail.

However, sketching is not about drawing. Sketching is not simply about drawing an idea that is already in the mind. Instead, sketching is a creative cognitive activity
![](https://i.imgur.com/tTdLv16.png)
Sketching is an idea generation method that supports both convergent and divergent thinking in interaction design

Sketching can also avoid fixated too early in the process to a suboptimal idea

Sketching progresses from vague ideas towards concrete concepts.

Moggridge and Buxton popularized sketching techniques in interaction design

The fundamental idea is to alternate between two modes of sketching: divergent and convergent. In the divergent mode the designer sketches as much as possible – while suspending critique and disbelief. In the convergent mode the designer refines ideas. These modes can be alternated in different ways, for instance:

1. **Divergent sketching:** Generate as many ideas as you can within a time limit. Suspend criticism and avoid focusing on details. 
2. **Selection:** Assess the designs and select a handful for further elaborate. Ensure the selected designs are different. 
3. **Convergent sketching:** Create higher-fidelity versions of each selected design. 
4. **Divergent sketching:** Try again to generate novel sketches, no matter if they are related to the previously generated or not. 
5. **Selection:** Select the best designs out of all ideas generated so far. 
6. **Convergent sketching:** Create higher-fidelity versions of the selected ones. 
7. **Continue like this until you have just few (2-3) designs that you are happy with**
## Reconceptualizing problems
Besides generating ideas, designers find new ways to conceptualize problems and situations. The metaphor is perhaps the most known of these techniques. It is a way to understand something unfamiliar in terms of something familiar. More precisely, a metaphor is a conceptual mapping between a vehicle concept and a topic concept.

the desktop metaphor maps physical properties of a desktop (vehicle) to interactions with a file system (topic).
## Summary
• Problem solving is central to understanding design work. 

• Bias and design fixation limits exploration of new ideas and hence reduces the quality of the design process. 

• Problems need to be well-defined. Goal refinement is a process of ensuring design tasks contain design decisions, a design space, objectives, and constraints. 

• Creativity can be facilitated via systematic use of creative methods can therefore assist in generating ideas. Many different creative methods exist for this purpose.
# 32 Design Practice
There are at least six causes for design practice: 
1. Designers need to renew themselves to be creative. 
2. Design has multiple objectives and constraints. 
3. Design choices are made under uncertainty. 
4. Design is affected by many contextual factors. 
5. Design projects consist of many stakeholders, materials, and documents to consider. 
6. Design is a multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort.

methods used interaction design: sketching, personas, interviews, affinity diagramming, and heuristic evaluation

Another motivation to study design practice is innovation. If we want to improve interactions with computers, we need to facilitate the designers that design those interactions
## Prototyping
To prototype means to produce an instance of an idea that serves as a model that allows assessment. The term proto implies a sense of incompleteness: a prototype is created accepting that it is not final.

Used in HCI: 
- Studying the feasibility of an idea by creating it. Creating a prototype insists on taking a stance on key decisions, something that may still be still avoided while ideating or sketching.
- Presenting an idea in a concrete form for others, such as users and colleagues, to experience and test.

Design research distinguishes a continuum of prototyping fidelity:

1. Low-fidelity prototypes, such as paper prototypes or prototype made with rapid prototyping tools. 
2. Medium-fidelity prototypes include more details about each element, such are their type, color, and position. 
3. High-fidelity prototypes are best-effort simulacra of the final product and cover key details that affect interaction in selected prime scenarios.
## Reflection and Critique
reflective practices can be divided according to two dimensions
**In-action vs. out-action** In—reflections that occur while designing. Out—reflections outside of design. 

**Remembering vs. gathering** Reflection that focuses on the past versus the collection of new materials.
### Interpretative activities
Sensemaking is an activity in design driven by the need to find connections among otherwise disconnected facets
### Design critique
Crits are sessions where designers meet to review designs. A design is presented, for example the wireframe designs of a graphical user interface, and explanations are provided for design choices. These choices are then discussed with peers. 

You would be surprised how often someone accidentally make a graphical design which resembles either a penis or a swastika. This is not intentional and you shouldn't feel bad for doing this if it isn't intenntional, but it highlight why design critique can be quite important.
## Summary
• The study of design practice looks at what methods and practices designers actually follow, as opposed to what they are supposed to. Understanding practice is important for the development of tools and services for designers. 

• Designers not only solve problems but make sense of materials to refine them. They reflect on their own practices to improve them and position as designers. 

• Designers experiment with ideas by creating sketches and prototypes at different levels of fidelity. 

• Design fiction helps designers take distance from the present and develop possible futures centered on a design idea.
# 33 Design Processes
![Uploading file...t7st9]()

A core insight in HCI’s process models is that having a design process does not need to be antithetical to creativity. A process can be set to make room for and facilitate creativity. In other words, creativity can be managed just like engineering projects can be managed

There are three other shared aspects in HCI’s process models:

**User focus** Setting user-related end goals: Success criteria for a project are defined in terms relating to the user (e.g., as opposed to purely economic or technical terms).

**Iteration** Recognizing the fact that perfect solutions are practically impossible to come up with in a single shot, HCI’s process models integrate iterative design at their heart.

**Evaluation** with users The goodness of a design is demonstrated by reference to empirical or other evaluation that involves users.
## User-centered design processes
most user-centered, sometimes called humancentered, design processes share four core phases, although different terminology is used:
1. User research 
2. Formation of design goals (requirements) 
3. Generation of design ideas (design)
4. Evaluation
There are numerous user- and human-centered design process models. They can be distinguished according to eight dimensions:

usability tests

The ISO 9241 standard: a company that complies with the standard can be perceived to be more reliable and trustworthy for a client
## Usability engineering
The usability engineering lifecycle is perhaps the most successful user-centric process model that had an impact on software engineering processes

introduced by Nielsen in the early 1990s
### Nielsen usability model  (usability engineering lifecycle)
The model has ten phases:
1. Know thy user
2. Competitive analysis: analyze existing products to understand their design
3. Setting usability goals: Nielsen proposed five general types of goals: learnability, efficiency, re-learnability (ability of infrequent users to return to use the system without having to learn it all over), user errors, and subjective user satisfaction.
4. Design stage: The main objective here is to produce a usable implementation that can be tested and, if successful in meeting the goals, deployed
5. Coordinated design
6. Guidelines and heuristics: Heuristic evaluation refers to the use of rules-of-thumb to assess a design.
7. Prototyping
8. Empirical user testing
9. Iterative design
10. Collecting feedback from the field
### A standard for human-centered design (ISO)
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

ISO9241-220:2019 standard defines a process model for human-centered design.
![](https://i.imgur.com/eopmLrO.png)
The earlier versions of the standard focused on usability, defined in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a particular context of use. The latest version from 2019 also includes accessibility, user experience, and avoiding harm as stated goals for design.

The standard is consequently divided to four sub-processes:

• HCP.1.: Processes to ensure enterprise-level focus on users. 
• HCP.2: Processes to enable human-centred design across projects and systems. 
• HCP.3. Processes to execute human-centred design within a project. 
• HCP.4: Processes to introduce, operate, and end a syste
### A standard for ethical system design
There is an increasing need to ensure that technology utilizing AI works in an ethically acceptable way. However, this is very difficult to address in complex real-world projects, because different stakeholders have different values, and a system’s effect on them may not be obvious.

The IEEE Standard 7000 is a process model for addressing ethical concerns during system design and minimize potential harm to users

Relevant stakeholders are selected for value identification. Their values are recorded, including detailed analysis of benefits and harms from an utilitarian perspective.

A key question to ask is: ‘’What benefits or harms would arise if the system was deployed in the way we envision it?” This analysis is utilitarian; in other words, it concerns the consequences of possible events

## Summary
• Design processes define the order and manner in which design methods and techniques should be applied in a project. They are normative accounts of design, describing how it is supposed to be done. 

• Most process models are iterative and have four stages: user research, requirements specification, design generation, and evaluation. 

• Agile methods emphasize fast iteration and reactiveness over long-term planning. 

• Usability engineering is a widely adopted process model for ensuring interactive systems have high usability. It has been criticized as being glorified trial and error and lacking connections to theory. • Despite being normative and based on an idealized assumption of design, following a process has many benefits over ad hoc practices.
