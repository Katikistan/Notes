## Summary
# Design Practice
methods used interaction design: sketching, personas, interviews, affinity diagramming, and heuristic evaluation

Another motivation to study design practice is innovation. If we want to improve interactions with computers, we need to facilitate the designers that design those interactions
## Prototyping
To prototype means to produce an instance of an idea that serves as a model that allows assessment. The term proto implies a sense of incompleteness: a prototype is created accepting that it is not final.

Used in HCI: 
- Studying the feasibility of an idea by creating it. Creating a prototype insists on taking a stance on key decisions, something that may still be still avoided while ideating or sketching.
- Presenting an idea in a concrete form for others, such as users and colleagues, to experience and test.

Design research distinguishes a continuum of prototyping fidelity:

1. Low-fidelity prototypes, such as paper prototypes or prototype made with rapid prototyping tools. 
2. Medium-fidelity prototypes include more details about each element, such are their type, color, and position. 
3. High-fidelity prototypes are best-effort simulacra of the final product and cover key details that affect interaction in selected prime scenarios.
## Reflection and Critique
reflective practices can be divided according to two dimensions
**In-action vs. out-action** In—reflections that occur while designing. Out—reflections outside of design. 

**Remembering vs. gathering** Reflection that focuses on the past versus the collection of new materials.
### Interpretative activities
Sensemaking is an activity in design driven by the need to find connections among otherwise disconnected facets
