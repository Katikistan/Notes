## 1.1 Why is HCI Challenging?
**First,** humans are complex biological and social organisms. HCI must account for individual differences. What may work for one user may be a failure for another.

Individual differences in computer use are whopping, not only in terms of performance,
but in terms of what is considered interesting or culturally appropriate. 

Most people don’t know how to scroll, navigate. We need to do basic HCI work to make text larger.

**Second,** the computer is the most complex tool humans have devised. Designing systems with this level of complexity that computers have is inherently challenging.

**Third,** HCI involves people interacting with computers in complex contexts where they
attempting to carry out a variety of goals. Thus, HCI requires some systems thinking.

In HCI, even if we often focus on a subsystem (e.g., interaction with a graphical user interface), successful deployment relies on the ability to understand and relate observations to their wider, system-level context.

**Fourth,** design is hard. The purpose of HCI is, ultimately, to impact the design of
applications, interaction techniques, systems, or services so that users can achieve their
goals in an effective, efficient, safe, and satisfactory manner. 

**Why is design hard?** no perfect design— you identify tradeoffs and generate solutions that each trade off certain things in exchange for others, such as a user’s speed for accuracy. 

Hard to let go of old ideas and generate new ideas that are also valuable. 

Easy to introduce mistakes early in the process, such as accidentally injecting faulty user requirements based on misunderstandings, which later are exceedingly difficult to correct.

## 1.2 Human-Computer Interaction as a Field
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - started an initiative that provided education for and defined the term *HCI*:
		*Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.*

**There are three noteworthy parts in the definition:**
- *HCI* is about building interactive systems. It is concered with design, engineering, and implementation to improve the interactive systems we use and invent new ones.

- People are the point of departure for *HCI* and define what makes computing technology good. This differs from other areas of computer science which focus on computation and algorithms rather than the user.

- *HCI* is concerned with investigating the phenomena relevant to interaction such as social, organizational, psychological, and many other factors. *HCI is concerned with understanding the influcence technology has on how people think, value, feel, and relate. 

Three main types of research problem can be distinguished in HCI

**Empirical problems**
These concern developing accounts of phenomena in interaction
grounded on empirical data. motivated by a lack of understanding of some aspect of interaction.  An example: to understand the consequences of social media on relationships. may be about “all major phenomena surrounding interaction”.

**Conceptual problems**
explaining previously unconnected phenomena occurring in interaction by reference to theoretical constructs. Involve hypotheses, explanations, theories, and models. An example, to build a theory of what it means for users to feel immersed in virtual reality.

**Constructive problems**
These tackle the knowledge needed for constructing interactive systems for some stated purpose in human use of computing. does not need to be expressed formally in terms of models. Constructive problems may just as well concern visions for building brain-computer interfaces or guidelines that help designers create accessible user interfaces.

human-computer interaction is also a practice.
- Many HCI practitioners work to create an understanding of users and their activities.
- Most actively contribute and often drive constructive activities.
- HCI practitioners also evaluate interactive systems from the user’s perspective.

## 1.3 Fundamental Concepts
### Human-Centered
HCI focuses on the people who use an interactive system or are affected by its use. This
focus is often called being user-centered or human-centered
a requirement to understand users, their needs and motivations; 
a requirement to engage with people as part of research and design
a requirement for an ethical consideration of how an interactive system may directly or indirectly affect people.
![|400](https://i.imgur.com/Fmw8d2K.png)
we want it to match people – rather than requiring people to match the system
### Interaction
Interaction is, not a property of the system design nor that of the user, but something that emerges when they influence each other.

need to understand the interaction to understand how users can be supported in their tasks.
### User Interfaces
A key technical construct for HCI is the user interface. It refers to those parts of an
interactive system that the user comes into contact with or that in other ways shape the
users’ perception of the system.(Hornbæk, 1.3.3)
### Design
HCI aims to change the world by designing human-centered systems. Designing is a
process of arriving at a plan, specification, prototype, system, or service—a design.

HCI, this often means designing a user interface and relevant parts of the underlying
interactive system. However, it can also be about designing, for example, services.
### Engineering
Engineering refers to using technical principles, such as mathematics, science, and technical know-how, to realize a design that best meets a given set of expectations, which are often captured in a requirements specification.
### Evaluation
HCI research has a relatively strong emphasis on carrying out evaluations with users, which contrasts with some technically-oriented disciplines measuring technical properties without the involvement of people. Verification, validation, and testing are variants of evaluation.

**Verification means**
ensuring that the design meets all requirements and constraints imposed for the design
task.

**Validation means**
ensuring the design is fit for its intended purpose.

**testing**
(e.g., usability testing) refers to (testing) it in realistic conditions. For example, in usability testing (Chapter 42), evaluation is carried out by asking users to perform the tasks assigned to them. Several usability metrics are used to gauge how well they succeeded.
## 1.4 Why HCI Matters
ensuring that  systems have a positive impact on the world and their users. It requires discipline. 
### 1.4.1. Interactive Systems are Difficult to Use
many users had difficulties in understanding how to provide input and how to interpret output.  even door handles may be difficult (Push to open, but there is a handle)

### 1.4.2. The Egocentric Fallacy
It is an egocentric fallacy to assume that others are like us. You are often NOT the user. As a consequence, intuition can only go so far and is often misleading. 

"I understand it like this and it is obviously how everybody sees it to"

We must use time and energy to understand users.

### 1.4.3. HCI is Right
We have a responsibility to take the needs and abilities of other people seriously when designing technology. In the words of designer Dieter Rams, “Indifference towards people and the reality they live in is the one and only cardinal sin in design.”

### 1.4.4. HCI Pays Off
HCI also has financial value when done correctly, as it can help open up and conquer new markets, increase productivity, and lower costs. 

### 1.4.5 HCI invents the future
Two essential strategies for bringing something new to the market are market pull and technology push. 

Market pull means sensing there is market demand for a new offering.

## Summary of Chapter 1
- Computing is a powerful tool; interactive systems and user interfaces help control and tame it.
- Human-computer interaction is concerned with people, creating technology, and understanding interaction.
- Essential activities in HCI are understanding people, studying what users need and want, designing and engineering interactive systems, and evaluating their benefits to users.
- HCI is important because you are not the user. HCI offers a disciplined approach to some hard problems faced in design and innovation.

# Chapter 2  
### Perception

### Motor control

### Thinking

### Needs

### Experience

### Communication

## 2.1 Types of understanding
### Concepts

### Taxonomies

### Theories

### Models

### Guidelines

## Summary Chapter 2
- A deep and scientific engagement with interactive systems and the phenomena that surrounds them begins with people. We call that approach human-centered.

- This part of the book shows how being human-centered requires us to draw on theories and models of how people feel, think, and behave.

- These understandings of people are general, holding across many individuals, many types of user interfaces, and many different use contexts.
# Chapter 3
## Perception 
## 3.1

(fixations)
We focus attention not in random, but on elements
that have some probability of being the ones we look for.

More generally, perception is the ability to collect and organize information about the
environment through physiological sensory systems. Thus, perception refers not only to
the subjective sensory experience of the interface. It also refers to the processes that
help us organize a representation of the display.

The second process concerns expectations. Over years of interacting with
the world, we have accumulated prior experience. Such experiences enable the brain to
project its expectations back to the world. To achieve this, perception utilizes internal
models to constantly make guesses on how the world might be. Internal models allow us to deal with the fact that sensory stimulation is relatively poor. They fill in the blanks.

Sensory modalities commonly used in HCI include
vision, hearing (audition), and touch (tactition).

Attention refers to the ability to focus processing on a
select portion of the full perceptual scene.
## 3.2
## 3.3

## Summary Chapter 3
- Perceptual experience is not determined by what is shown on the display alone, but in conjunction with our expectations and strategies of deploying attention.

- Perception in HCI can be understood via elementary tasks it needs to serve: discimination, detection, recognition, estimation, and search.

- Another main role of perception is to ’bring order into chaos’, in other words organize the overwhelming sensory experience into something we can act on.

- Visual saliency refers to the probability with which something on display attracts our visual attention. When the user interface is cluttered, all visual primitives are ’congested’ and nothing can be made to stand out from the page.

## Summary Chapter 4
- Motor control is necessary for users to perform actions in a user interface.
- The time it takes users to perform actions can be predicted for some fundamental activities, such as pointing, crossing, steering and reacting to stimuli.
