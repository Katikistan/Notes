# 1 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction
svært at imødekomme både eksperter og begynders behov.
## 1.1 Why is HCI Challenging?
**First,** humans are complex biological and social organisms. HCI must account for individual differences. What may work for one user may be a failure for another.

Individual differences in computer use are whopping, not only in terms of performance,
but in terms of what is considered interesting or culturally appropriate. 

Most people don’t know how to scroll, navigate. We need to do basic HCI work to make text larger.

**Second,** the computer is the most complex tool humans have devised. Designing systems with this level of complexity that computers have is inherently challenging.

**Third,** HCI involves people interacting with computers in complex contexts where they
attempting to carry out a variety of goals. Thus, HCI requires some systems thinking.

In HCI, even if we often focus on a subsystem (e.g., interaction with a graphical user interface), successful deployment relies on the ability to understand and relate observations to their wider, system-level context.

**Fourth,** design is hard. The purpose of HCI is, ultimately, to impact the design of
applications, interaction techniques, systems, or services so that users can achieve their
goals in an effective, efficient, safe, and satisfactory manner. 

**Why is design hard?** no perfect design— you identify tradeoffs and generate solutions that each trade off certain things in exchange for others, such as a user’s speed for accuracy. 

Hard to let go of old ideas and generate new ideas that are also valuable. 

Easy to introduce mistakes early in the process, such as accidentally injecting faulty user requirements based on misunderstandings, which later are exceedingly difficult to correct.

## 1.2 Human-Computer Interaction as a Field
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - started an initiative that provided education for and defined the term *HCI*:
		*Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.*

**There are three noteworthy parts in the definition:**
- *HCI* is about building interactive systems. It is concered with design, engineering, and implementation to improve the interactive systems we use and invent new ones.

- People are the point of departure for *HCI* and define what makes computing technology good. This differs from other areas of computer science which focus on computation and algorithms rather than the user.

- *HCI* is concerned with investigating the phenomena relevant to interaction such as social, organizational, psychological, and many other factors. *HCI is concerned with understanding the influcence technology has on how people think, value, feel, and relate. 

Three main types of research problem can be distinguished in HCI

**Empirical problems**
These concern developing accounts of phenomena in interaction
grounded on empirical data. motivated by a lack of understanding of some aspect of interaction.  An example: to understand the consequences of social media on relationships. may be about “all major phenomena surrounding interaction”.

**Conceptual problems**
explaining previously unconnected phenomena occurring in interaction by reference to theoretical constructs. Involve hypotheses, explanations, theories, and models. An example, to build a theory of what it means for users to feel immersed in virtual reality.

**Constructive problems**
These tackle the knowledge needed for constructing interactive systems for some stated purpose in human use of computing. does not need to be expressed formally in terms of models. Constructive problems may just as well concern visions for building brain-computer interfaces or guidelines that help designers create accessible user interfaces.

human-computer interaction is also a practice.
- Many HCI practitioners work to create an understanding of users and their activities.
- Most actively contribute and often drive constructive activities.
- HCI practitioners also evaluate interactive systems from the user’s perspective.

## 1.3 Fundamental Concepts
### Human-Centered
HCI focuses on the people who use an interactive system or are affected by its use. This
focus is often called being user-centered or human-centered
a requirement to understand users, their needs and motivations; 
a requirement to engage with people as part of research and design
a requirement for an ethical consideration of how an interactive system may directly or indirectly affect people.
![|400](https://i.imgur.com/Fmw8d2K.png)
we want it to match people – rather than requiring people to match the system
### Interaction
Interaction is, not a property of the system design nor that of the user, but something that emerges when they influence each other.

need to understand the interaction to understand how users can be supported in their tasks.
### User Interfaces
A key technical construct for HCI is the user interface. It refers to those parts of an
interactive system that the user comes into contact with or that in other ways shape the
users’ perception of the system.(Hornbæk, 1.3.3)
### Design
HCI aims to change the world by designing human-centered systems. Designing is a
process of arriving at a plan, specification, prototype, system, or service—a design.

HCI, this often means designing a user interface and relevant parts of the underlying
interactive system. However, it can also be about designing, for example, services.
### Engineering
Engineering refers to using technical principles, such as mathematics, science, and technical know-how, to realize a design that best meets a given set of expectations, which are often captured in a requirements specification.
### Evaluation
HCI research has a relatively strong emphasis on carrying out evaluations with users, which contrasts with some technically-oriented disciplines measuring technical properties without the involvement of people. Verification, validation, and testing are variants of evaluation.

**Verification means**
ensuring that the design meets all requirements and constraints imposed for the design
task.

**Validation means**
ensuring the design is fit for its intended purpose.

**testing**
(e.g., usability testing) refers to (testing) it in realistic conditions. For example, in usability testing (Chapter 42), evaluation is carried out by asking users to perform the tasks assigned to them. Several usability metrics are used to gauge how well they succeeded.
## 1.4 Why HCI Matters
ensuring that  systems have a positive impact on the world and their users. It requires discipline. 
### 1.4.1. Interactive Systems are Difficult to Use
many users had difficulties in understanding how to provide input and how to interpret output.  even door handles may be difficult (Push to open, but there is a handle)

### 1.4.2. The Egocentric Fallacy
It is an egocentric fallacy to assume that others are like us. You are often NOT the user. As a consequence, intuition can only go so far and is often misleading. 

"I understand it like this and it is obviously how everybody sees it to"

We must use time and energy to understand users.

### 1.4.3. HCI is Right
We have a responsibility to take the needs and abilities of other people seriously when designing technology. In the words of designer Dieter Rams, “Indifference towards people and the reality they live in is the one and only cardinal sin in design.”

### 1.4.4. HCI Pays Off
HCI also has financial value when done correctly, as it can help open up and conquer new markets, increase productivity, and lower costs. 

### 1.4.5 HCI invents the future
Two essential strategies for bringing something new to the market are market pull and technology push. 

Market pull means sensing there is market demand for a new offering.

## Summary of Chapter 1
- Computing is a powerful tool; interactive systems and user interfaces help control and tame it.
- Human-computer interaction is concerned with people, creating technology, and understanding interaction.
- Essential activities in HCI are understanding people, studying what users need and want, designing and engineering interactive systems, and evaluating their benefits to users.
- HCI is important because you are not the user. HCI offers a disciplined approach to some hard problems faced in design and innovation.

# 2 Introduction to Understanding People
## Types of understanding
### Concepts

### Taxonomies

### Theories

### Models

### Guidelines
## Areas of understanding
### Seven areas of understanding people
Special application areas
User groups
### Individual differences
## Applying our understanding of people
## Is a general understanding of people possible?
## Summary
• A deep and scientific engagement with interactive systems and the phenomena that surrounds them begins with people. We call that approach human-centered. 

• This part of the book shows how being human-centered requires us to draw on theories and models of how people feel, think, and behave. 

• These understandings of people are general, holding across many individuals, many types of user interfaces, and many different use contexts.

# 3 Perception 
A sensory modality is a biologically specialized system dedicated to a type of transduction
![[Pasted image 20230324093503.png|300]]
In the case of perception, we do this by drawing on concepts and models developed in biology, neuroscience, and the cognitive sciences. This may help us do the following in HCI:

Explain why people use computers in the way they do. For instance, Figure 3.1 suggests that visual search on a UI is influenced by both expectations and visual features of the page.

The understanding in this chapter directly underlie guidelines for

effective designs and may be used to evaluate UIs. For instance, the gestalt laws for visual perception explain how visual stimuli are organized into wholes
## Sensory modalities
Sensation is a physiological process that produces information about the environment for perception.

a sensory system transforms energy in one form – say light or physical contact – to electro-chemical events in the brain that produce the experience of sensation
Human sensory modalities are served by three basic types of transduction [723]: 

**Mechanosensitivity** Example: kinaesthesia (sense of own movement), touch, hearing, and equilibrium; Here, physical contact energy is transduced, for example via hair cells in the ear. 

**Chemosensitivity** Examples: gustation and olfaction; Here, chemical properties are transduced, like, for example, by taste buds on the tongue. 

**Photosensitivity** Example: the retina; Here, stimulation by photons is transduced.
![|400](https://i.imgur.com/Z9z68ah.png)
These sensory modalities differ vastly with respect to the properties important for interaction. In HCI, we consider the following differences as important: 
1. Information rate: How much information can be sensed per unit of time. This is tricky to measure except for visual and auditory perception. 

3. *Parallelism:* How much parallel processing of information can occur? For example, vision is highly parallel and, while audition also can do parallel processing, it is less so. 

4. *Sensitivity* refers to the minimum intensity of the physical stimulation for a receptor to exceed its sensation threshold. Vision has unrivalled speed and sensitivity over other sensory systems. This can be measured and modeled using psychophysics (see below). 

5. *Receptive field* is the size of the region that produces an integrate feature. It is a measure of association between neurons and receptors. 

6. *Adaptation:* Tuning of outputs to attenuate non-informative signals. (See ’habituation’ below.)
### Constructing percepts from sensory information
### Multimodal perception
In most HCI tasks, sensory modalities rarely operate on their own. Everyday interaction requires integration of information not only within a modality but across modalities.

when you are pointing with a mouse, four modalities participate: proprioception (feeling the angles of the joints moving), tactition (feeling the palm of the hand move against the surface), audition (hearing the movement), and vision (seeing the hand move and the mouse cursor move).
## Elementary functions of perception in HCI
### Discrimination
The task of telling whether a difference occurs in sensory stimulation

In a discrimination task, the user must decide whether some level of stimulation is available or if that level has changed from some reference. Discrimination threshold defines the minimum level of stimulation required for sensing. For example, healthy young adults can hear sounds between 20 and about 20,000 Hz. With aging or hearing loss, discrimination thresholds change.
### Detection
The task of telling whether an event of interest occurs (or not) in the environment

Consider for example playing a game and having to decide if a shadowy dark contour in distance is another player, or a radiologist examining an computer tomography image and having to decide if cancer is present or not.

In a noisy environment, detection performance is limited by the observer’s ability to discriminate the signal from noise (sensitivity).
### Recognition
The task of categorizing a stimulus as something

In a recognition task, a stimulus must be classified as one out of a number of classes. For example, icons, words, faces, alarm sounds, etc., need to be recognized as a particular member of a set. All other things being equal, the larger the set, the harder the recognition. Discrimination becomes harder as more candidates compete.

Moreover, it is important for machine learning. Crowdworkers are often used to classify data that are used to train algorithms. However, people do not always agree on what what the ’true’ classes are. Categories that show disagreement among human observers are problematic for machine learning, because they add noise to the training data.
### Estimation
The task of estimating a property of an object of event in the environment

Estimation is the task of assessing a property of an object from stimulus information. Users may be estimating, for example, the size of a 3D object in a VR environment or the (true) color of a product on an e-commerce site.
### Search
The task of localizing an object of interest.
In search tasks, the location-in-space of some object must be determined. In auditory search, the task is to localize the source of a given sound. We talk about visual search as a case below

### fixations
We focus attention not in random, but on elements
that have some probability of being the ones we look for.

More generally, perception is the ability to collect and organize information about the
environment through physiological sensory systems. Thus, perception refers not only to
the subjective sensory experience of the interface. It also refers to the processes that
help us organize a representation of the display.

The second process concerns expectations. Over years of interacting with
the world, we have accumulated prior experience. Such experiences enable the brain to
project its expectations back to the world. To achieve this, perception utilizes internal
models to constantly make guesses on how the world might be. Internal models allow us to deal with the fact that sensory stimulation is relatively poor. They fill in the blanks.
![](https://i.imgur.com/LojBOAL.png)

Sensory modalities commonly used in HCI include
vision, hearing (audition), and touch (tactition).

Attention refers to the ability to focus processing on a
select portion of the full perceptual scene.

## Visual perception and attention
Visual perception refers to perception through sensing of stimulation by light.

The human visual system is proposed to involve three neuroanatomically distinct pathways

1. ’What’: The ventral pathway, which encodes the identity of visual objects, such as those of tools, faces, or animals. In the case of graphical user interfaces, it recognizes the types of elements and objects on the displays. 

2. ’Where’ and ’How’: The dorsal pathway that encodes the locations of visual objects and actions related to these objects. In the case of graphical user interfaces, it registers which elements can be clicked and tracks moving objects. 

3. ”Who’: More recently, a third pathway has been discovered. The superior temporal sulcus is proposed that specializes in dynamic social processing. It processes the actions of moving objects and bodies, such as their expressions, gaze, intentions, and moods. In the case of graphical user interfaces, it is deployed in situations such as virtual reality, games, and videoconferencing.
### Limits to the human visual system
Ware [814] summarized key limits to the visual system under the concept of Windows of Visibility. A ’window’ is a metaphor to describe physiological limits posed to visual perception. We here describe four windows important for HCI: 

1. visible spectrum of light : we can only perceive a limited range in the spectrum of light

3. field of view : our field of view is limited, to about 190 degrees horizontally and 125 degrees vertically

4. contrast: our perception of detail is limited. Contrast refers to difference in luminance and color that make something in the field of view to stand out from the rest.

5. foveated vision: retinal image loses accuracy at the periphery. Vision is physiologically divided into two regions: **Foveal vision** narrow but precise, high-fidelity perception around the point where you fixation. **Peripheral vision** the rest of the field of view, which has eccentrically decreasing fidelity. The farther away from the foveal area, the lower the fidelity.
### Eye movements
**Fixations** encode information about the visual scene consist of multiple microfixations, each a few tens of milliseconds. 

**Saccades** move the gaze point in ballistic leaps that during which the scene is not perceived. They are ballistic, in the sense that the target of the saccade is no

**Smooth pursuit:** Smooth following of moving targets, such as when following an animated character moving on the display. No saccading occurs. An example of an innovative application in HCI is shown in the side box
### Perceptual organization
Figure/ground perception refers to the organization of visual experience in a visuospatial hierarchy. 
#### Gestalt principper
● Proximity  
● Similarity  
● Continuity  
● Memory load (data entry, display)  
● Information assimilation (display)  
● Flexibility (data entry, display)

four commonly used principles of visual grouping
**Proximity** The closer some elements are together and the farther apart they are from others, the stronger they are grouped together. 
**Common area** Elements that are located in the same closed region are grouped together. 
**Similarity** Elements that are similar in e.g. color, size or orientation are grouped together. 
**Continuation** Elements that are connected by continuation of flow are grouped together.
![](https://i.imgur.com/MoCBlkw.png)
### Visual Attention
Visual attention is traditionally considered to consist of three processes:
**Selective attention** The ability to shift attention to a desired object or location 
**Vigilance** The ability to sustain attention on something for a longer period
**Divided attention** The ability to share attention between one or more objects, locations, or tasks.
### Visual search
The goal is to find an element on the display, for example an icon or a label of interest.
There are three factors contributing to this: 
1. visual features of the display: When the target is unique in any of these features, search is fast. It is fast, because such features can be spotted peripherally by the perceptual system. In feature (or disjunctive) search, visual search is based on so-called visual primitives like color, shape, size, curvature, orientation, or motion.
3. learning: If you have seen an item for a few times, it is easier to locate it.
4. strategic control

### Visual saliency
Saliency refers to the probability with which a graphical element can attract visual attention during the first seconds of viewing a display

Attention, generally, is drawn to **visually unique elements**. Through color and bold facing, the words stand out relative to the rest of this paragraph.

in an image full of green tones and green-filled shapes, if a color such as red appears, observers tend to look at the red shape

In natural scenes such as looking at a forest, there is a tendency to look at the center and the horizontal line.

In UI Attention tends to be drawn to the top-left quadrant of the page.

Also, colorfulness is a poorer predictor of saliency than in natural scenes. Instead, attention is drawn to large texts and images with faces.
## Perception is an active process
Experienced users, for example, rely more on long-term memory than novices.
## Summary Chapter 3
- Perceptual experience is not determined by what is shown on the display alone, but in conjunction with our expectations and strategies of deploying attention.

- Perception in HCI can be understood via elementary tasks it needs to serve: discimination, detection, recognition, estimation, and search.

- Another main role of perception is to ’bring order into chaos’, in other words organize the overwhelming sensory experience into something we can act on.

- Visual saliency refers to the probability with which something on display attracts our visual attention. When the user interface is cluttered, all visual primitives are ’congested’ and nothing can be made to stand out from the page.
# 4 Motor control 
Human motor control refers to the regulation of all movement in a human
## Fundamental motor control models for HCI
These models govern three actions: pointing, crossing and steering. Note that sometimes these models are described using the term ”law”, which can be misleading. They are about statistical regularities captured in the shape of mathematical models
### Pointing
The first model concerns pointing. The time it takes a user to point to a target (for example, a 2D button) can be mathematically predicted using Fitts’ law.

Fitts’ law is a mathematical model that predicts that the average movement time required to hit a target along a one-dimensional path is proportional to the difficulty of hitting a target. This “difficulty’ involves the distance to the target and the width of the target
	- Den er udledt vha ekspermentation.
```math
||{"id":159402039833}||

MT = a + bID
```
where a and b are regression coefficients and ID is known as the Index of Difficulty. The Index of Difficulty is an encoding of how far away the target is and how large it is and and it is defined as:
```math
||{"id":709887695761}||
I D=\log _2(\frac{D+W}{W})=\log _2(\frac{D}{W}+1)
```
where D is the distance to the target and W is the width to the target.
The closer the target is, the lower D is and hence the lower the Index of Difficulty. Similarly, the larger the target is, the larger W is and the lower the Index of Difficulty


- Movement constraints
	 - Spatially constrained aimed movements are restricted at the end or during the movement to a specified region or point. Discrete aimed movements are movements to spatially bounded targets.
	 - Temporally constrained aimed movements must hit a target defined in time. The target can be hit during a specific interval, or the goal is to be as close to the target as possible.

- Simple and Choice Reactions
	- Simple reaction is another fundamental motor action in HCI: Something appears on the display or in the environment, and the user must respond to it as quickly as possible.
	- Choice reaction generalizes this to the case where more than one response option is available


### Crossing
A crossing task is a task that relaxes the stopping constraint in Fitts’ law, the D parameter of the target

in fitts law: when a user is attempting to hit a target, the user needs to both move the pointer to the target and stop the pointer before leaving the target.

in a crossing task, the user does not need to stop within the target. However, the user does, in fact, need to ensure the target is crossed. The width parameter W here refers to the size of the target the user is crossing

crossing tasks follow a similar statistical relationship as Fitts’ law and can be described using the same equation as Fitts’ law:

![|200](https://i.imgur.com/LQIhMDX.png)

### Steering
Finally, a steering task is a task where the user is moving a cursor through a form of tunnel constraint, proposed by Jhonny Accot and Shumin Zhai
### Target Acquisition
Aimed movements are movements where success is defined by external constraints. 

Two fundamental types of movement constraints can be distinguished:

*Spatially constrained aimed movements* are restricted at the end or during the movement to a specified region or point. An example is moving a mouse cursor on top of a button to select it.

*Temporally constrained aimed movements* must hit a target defined in time. In an interception task, we need to catch a moving object by (1) placing a selector on its future path and (2) pressing the button when the object is within the selector’s effective region.
### Fitts’ law
Fitts’ law is considered one of the most successful models in HCI
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/ZYk4DLL.png)
here is an example of data from a  stylus pointing task

what happens when distance increases and when width is decreased. Both increase ID and therefore also MT. In other words, other things being equal, targets that are further away or smaller are harder and therefore slower to point. In other words, movement time is related to the inverse of spatial error.

However, the obtained model is brittle: Even small changes in the task, user, or conditions can insist on re-obtaining the parameters. When D or W are set to extreme values, many things that affect motor control change: the muscles we use, posture, and visual feedback.

Fitts’ law is a simplification of what happens in pointing. Because it models mean MT in ID conditions, it effectively hides variability other than in end points
### Effective width
Analyzing the information-theoretical relation further, Scott MacKenzie and colleagues provided a widely used variant
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/zfwGHza.png)
W<sub>e</sub> is effective width
## Choice reaction

## Gesturing
Gestural interfaces are based on continuous shapes as input. Consider for example handwriting as text input: in order for a letter to be recognizable by the decoder, the shape must obey certain segment lengths and curves.
## Simple and Choice Reaction
Simple reaction is another fundamental motor action in HCI: Something appears on the display or in the environment, and the user must respond to it as quickly as possible.
Typing a phrase, for instance, is much more complex, since one must consecutively select (choose) the right key from a set of at least 26 alternative characters. We call those **choice reactions.** 

**Simple reaction** tasks are among the fastest human responses in HCI. Performance in this task is measured in milliseconds

### Ratcliff Model
The Ratcliff model is an evidence accumulation model that predicts the distribution of reaction times as a function of what happens after the stimulus has appeared

• **Stimulus onset:** The event that one should respond to appears, for example: a big figure suddenly on the screen in a first-person shooting game; 

• **Perceptual encoding:** The event is encoded as a candidate for one that should be responded to; Example: encoding the visual shape and figure of the thing that appears; 

• **Evidence accumulation:** Every fixation samples more evidence pro/against the decision to respond; Example: ”Is this a friend or a foe in the game?”

• **Decision**: When enough evidence has accumulated to meet a decision threshold, the corresponding motor action is launched; Example; ”Yes, this is an enemy!” 

• **Motor action:** Launching the overt, movement response to trigger the proper response.
## Summary
- Motor control is necessary for users to perform actions in a user interface.
- The time it takes users to perform actions can be predicted for some fundamental activities, such as pointing, crossing, steering and reacting to stimuli.
