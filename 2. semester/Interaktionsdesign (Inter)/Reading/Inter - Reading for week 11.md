# Introduction to User Interfaces
## Definition and Elements
### Types of User Interfaces
### Forms
### Graphical User Interfaces
## Design Objectives
### Tradeoffs
### Supporting Novice, Intermediate and Expert Performance
## Design Space Analysis
### Morphological Analysis
### Joint System Analysis
### QoC: Questions, Options, Criteria
## Summary
- User interfaces are what the user comes into contact with when using an interactive system. 
- User interfaces comprise input devices, displays, interaction techniques, representations, and substrates. 
- The design of user interfaces faces a tradeoff between different, conflicting criteria.
# Input Devices
## Summary
- Input devices allow users to provide information into a computer system. At a high level, they involve three levels: computation, representation, and implementation. 

- Design factors for input devices include their temporal and spatial resolutions, accuracy, sensing modality, sensing interaction potential, sensing validity, integrality and separability, and accessibility. The choice of appropriate input devices will typically require a design decision involving these factors. 

- Input devices span a wide range but can be roughly divided into key-based devices, direct and indirect pointing devices and uncertain control devices. These input devices provide different opportunities and challenges for design, and thus some are more suitable for particular interaction context than others.
# Displays
## Summary
- Displays turn digital information into physical phenomena that users should be able to perceive accurately. 

- A key consideration is their match to the human visual system. Any change in a display, be it visual or otherwise, may not be perceived or perceived proportionally by the user
# Interaction Techniques
## Objectives for Interaction Techniques
### Tradeoffs in the design of interaction techniques
## Pointing techniques
## Selection and manipulation techniques
### Simple selection
### Menu selection
### Manipulation of Objects
### Text entry
## Two perspectives: Control and Learnability
### Control
### Learnability
## Summary 
- An interaction technique is a computer program that couples input and output processing, with the purpose of improving or enabling elementary interactive tasks.

- Many interaction techniques are about striking a desirable tradeoff between learnability and performance. Consider hotkeys versus menus, for example. 

- Changing from one technique to use another one introduces a learning cost, which users may be unwilling to endure despite long-term benefits. 
- Users do not need to learn how the algorithm of the interaction technique works. Instead, they learn through experience to predict the consequences of their actions (internal models theory). This takes time. However, by an appropriate feedback design, the learning process can be facilitated. 
- Design should focus not only on ultimate performance but on incentivizing users to start and persist learning the technique 
- Oft-researched interaction techniques include the pie menu, the marking menu, speed-dependent semantic zomoing, the CD gain function, and hypertext. 
- Interaction techniques must be evaluated with realistic tasks and by relevant user groups to estimate their achievable performance.
# Commands and Navigation
## Naming Objects and Actions
### Naming Objects and Actions
### Menu techniques
## Notational Systems
### Notational Systems
## Recognition versus Recall
## Summary 
- In user interfaces, naming the objects and actions is a important activity, in particular because users are likely to call objects and actions different things, the so-called vocabulary problem
# Graphical User Interfaces
## Design Objectives
### Visibility
### Consistency
### Minimizing Errors
### Accessibility
### Benefits and limits of direct manipulation
## Anatomy of a Graphical User Interface
### Graphical User Interface Elements
## Designing a Graphical User Interface
### Characteristics of design processes
### Visual Organization
### Icons
### Metaphors
## Summary 
- Graphical user interfaces were invented more than 40 years ago but is still the main interaction style in many computer systems. 

- Direct manipulation is a key principle of graphical user interfaces. 

- Graphical user interfaces exploit a number of visual design principles, including visual hierarchy, grid lines, and undo.
