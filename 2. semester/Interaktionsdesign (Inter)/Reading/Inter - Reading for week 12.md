# 45 Growing into the HCI Discipline
## 45.4 Appreciating Rigor (and Knowing When Not to)
HCI research is not without consequences: poor design and poor research can harm and even kill. As practitioners and researchers of HCI, a prime consideration is that we can stand behind the conclusions we draw – in other words, rigor. Rigor refers to being thorough and careful in research, doing one’s best to ensure the high quality of both the process and outcomes of studies.

The most important principle of rigor is that the claims we make must be commensurate with the evidence we bring to support them

For example, *if you claim that the results of your evaluative study ‘’prove” that your design is better than a baseline, how certain you are that there are no counter-examples or conditions where that claim fails?*

To prove is a strong claim. It requires a careful consideration of all circumstances. **Perhaps you meant that your results ”show” that in ‘’conditions X design A is better in these metrics than design B”?** But how certain are you that this result generalizes beyond the study itself?

Rigor is also about truthful presentation of results.
## Summary
- There are many principles in HCI. Understanding and applying such principles can help you when engaging with HCI problems. 
- You can learn from HCI research. It is important to learn to critically evaluate research in terms of contribution, validity, benefit, and significance. 
- HCI shapes the world and there are many ways to make an HCI contribution.
