# 10 Introduction to User Research
A main motivation for user research is the realization that, in general, you are not the user.

A key commitment in user-centered design is to understand first and design later.

The say-do problem. This problem comes from the frequent observation that what users say they do might differ from what they actually do. For instance, when people are asked how much they use the Internet, their self-reports have only a low correlation with the data of the log file [711].

Tacit knowledge refers to knowledge that we are largely unaware of, but can be easily put into use in the right situation. High-repetition motor skills, such as riding a bike or typing in a familiar password, are good examples. You cannot ask people how they ride a bike and get the full picture.

identifying what users need requires them to imagine the impact of new technology on their activities, which is very difficult

Technical systems have many types of users (e.g., think: teachers, students, and parents in a school information system). Moreover, there are also nonuser stakeholders; that is, groups that are affected by the system, or who affect it but do not necessarily actively use it.
## Goals of User Research
The primary goal of user research is to obtain, analyze, and represent knowledge about current or prospective users. We call this goal gathering knowledge for design.

They may be remembered by the acronym used by Benyon [64], PACT: People, Activities, Contexts, and Technologies.

the is–ought problem, that is, from descriptions of how things are, we cannot conclude how they should be. For example, imagine that you have collected vast amounts of data on what your users do on mobile devices, say, when they are cooking. What can you say about their need for a new service? The difficulty is that the essential characteristics of that new service may not be present in that user data. Hence, user research results are rarely strongly prescriptive of designs alone. That said, a significant value of user research is that it can convince stakeholders about the quality of decisions taken.
### PACT
#### People
People-related insights include user skills, personalities, socioeconomic status, abilities, beliefs, habits, motivations, needs, and wants. These types of insight involve the experiences and attitudes of users and their first-person views of themselves and their activities
#### Activities
The tasks users perform and the practices they engage in give us important information for design. What do users do? What do they strive to achieve, and in which contexts are they finding themselves in doing this?
#### Contexts of use
The different contexts people find themselves in when interacting with systems provide a rich source of potential insights. There are several contexts to consider. The physical context is related to the physical environment and may include weather, lighting, or the built environment. The social context covers the social environment of interaction, such as social relationships and activities with others. The organizational context relates to how interaction is situated within organizations, for example, power structures, division of labor, and formal and informal work hierarchies. The historical context may be related to previous exposure to practices and systems. Finally, the cultural context captures cultural beliefs and norms that affect the use of the system
#### Technologies
s Existing interactive systems and tools with which users interact serve as another important type of insight. This may include perceived pros and cons and any opinions on alternative solutions. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the point of user research is not to primarily focus on technology or to begin imagining technological solutions, but to focus on people

## Who is the ’User’ in ’User Research’ ?
It is essentially a three-step process, but both steps are crucial for successful user research.
**Target Audience**
The first step is to specify the target audience, which is a set of profiles that describe the user groups that the product, system, or service is intended to reach.
**Other Stakeholders** 
The second step is to specify other people directly affected by or involved in the use of the interactive system
**Sampling** 
Having settled on a set of profiles that accurately describe the target audience and other stakeholders, it is now possible to select representative users to research, this is called sampling
### Target Audience
The target audience is a description of the intended customers or users affected by your system, product, or service.

**There are many ways to form a profile for a target audience. One process that is frequently used in user research for product development is the following**
- First, consider the inclusion criteria for the profile. The *behavioral criterion* means including people who actually do or want to do the things you intend to enable with your product. The technological criterion involves considering people’s background and interest in relating technology, such as how frequently they use social media or interact with a spoken dialogue-based system. Finally, the demographical criterion means capturing people’s anticipated age, geographical location, household income, and so on. 

- Having considered behavioral, technological, and demographical criteria, it is possible to develop an initial profile. For example, consider a hypothetical wearable health monitor coupled with a smartphone, which is meant to use persuasive gamification methods to encourage a healthy lifestyle. An initial profile may then have a Demographics heading that says the intended age range is 25–55, gender is irrelevant, and it is specifically aimed at single people who are educated at the university level and have a post-tax income of USD 60,000. A Behaviors heading may state that this typical user walks or uses public transportation to go to work. Finally, a Technology-use and Experience heading may read that a person within the profile may use their mobile phone to browse the web and Facebook several times a day. 

- The next step is to review this initial profile in an attempt to make it suitable for user research. One trick is to try to identify additional criteria for ideal users that would provide the most valuable feedback. In the previous example, such a revision may, for example, involve updating the Behaviors heading to include additional criteria, such as a person in the target audience: (1) prefers not to exercise; (2) currently does not wear any form of a watch; and (3) talks about health issues with their friends

Perhaps the most prominent is that the users that we focus on in user research—interviewing, observing, surveying—should be representative, that is, a group of users who vary enough to be typical of the major types of users.

User-centered design should strive to cater to all audiences equally while considering their diverse needs. This means striving away from the urge to design for managers and oneself, and instead empirically studying who will, or *might* be, a user.

Another way to think about users is to deliberately look for variety in user groups. The motivation is that we want to understand users and their activities with as much nuance, complexity, and diversity as possible, because these may challenge us to create better designs. Identified groups should be different in terms of their needs, beliefs, contexts, purchasing power, and so on
### Sampling
A sampling of the user group. 
One consideration is representativeness: Is this user group representing the target audience or a valid segment of other stakeholders?

Another consideration is variability in the sample: Will we learn about the breadth and variety of the target audience’s attitudes and work? 

Yet another consideration is statistical power : Will this sample size be large enough to draw reliable conclusions about it? 

practical considerations:
**First,** access and availability: are these users available to study? 

**Second,** Cost-efficiency: Is this user group providing information for design that warrants the cost of studying them? 

**Third,** costs for users in participating: Does being part of user research present any cost or danger to participants? 

These considerations may lead to different choices regarding who and how many users to include.
### Stakeholders
other people are often affected by the systems, indirectly involved in their use, or benefiting from the system.

they may be parents of children who use a kid’s web page or coworkers of users of an accounting system. We call these people stakeholders

stakeholders do not directly need to interact with a system, and therefore may have different views and varying knowledge of the benefits, drawbacks, and activities relevant to the system. An app could to a person who engage with it be entertaining but for other annoying beacuse it's very noisy

consider an electronic system to cast votes in state elections. The primary ‘’users” are the citizens who will use the system to fill in the ballots and submit their votes. 

There are also secondary user groups, such as the professionals who install and maintain these systems, security engineers, and election monitors. However, beyond these users, there are several stakeholders who may not be directly using the system, such as the political parties involved in the election and the local organizations responsible for organizing election sites. Even the state can be considered a stakeholder

Mitchell et al. [532] propose three relationship attributes to start defining a stakeholder group: 
- power 
- legitimacy
- urgency

power refers to a relationship in which one group of users can get another group to do something. 

Second, legitimacy refers to the legal or normative basis of a stakeholder group. For example, hackers are illegitimate stakeholders in (too) many networked systems. 

Third, urgency refers to how time-sensitive a relationship is. Some groups are perceived as ‘’calling for attention” or ‘’in need of immediate attention”. Urgency can also be thought about by considering its criticality: What is the opportunity loss of not addressing this group versus the gain from addressing it? In short, urgency is about the timeliness and criticality of a group.

**Some stakeholder groups are latent:** they are only affected not directly but through some mediating mechanisms. For example, excessive use of gamification affects not only children playing mobile games, but also their parents. 

**Some stakeholders are dormant:** they are silent most of the time and are triggered only in special circumstances. For instance, legal experts are not stakeholders in the regular use of a system, but in the case of an accident or crime, this relationship changes
## User Research Methods
![](https://i.imgur.com/drOlOZr.png)
### Research Strategy
Research strategy concerns how to select one or more research methods for gathering insights about users. Studies that look at user-initiated

The first principle states that research methods bound what we can empirically learn. According to McGrath, “all methods have inherent flaws, although each has certain potential advantages”

The second principle of McGrath [516] states that the research strategy is about trading off conflicting criteria. The criteria are as follows, in no particular order:
#### Realism
concerns how similar the situation being studied is to the situations that the researcher wants to gather insights about. Studies that look at user-initiated behavior in its naturally occurring surroundings, such as field studies, are high in realism. Think out loud
#### Precision
concerns how much accuracy and detail one obtains about the users’ behavior and attitudes, and how much control there is over variables and circumstances of no interest. User studies that track every detail of people’s hand movements with motion-tracking equipment, for instance, are high in precision.
#### Generalizability
refers to how well the findings generalize to other people or situations. Studies that are able to get input from a lot of users, such as surveys, are often high in generalizability

The third principle of research strategy follows from the inherent limitations of methods— triangulation. McGrath [516] explained the idea as follows: “If you only use one method, there is no way to separate out the part that is the ’true’ measure of the concept in question from the part that mainly reflects the method itself. If you use multiple methods, carefully selected to have different strengths and weaknesses, the methods can add strength to each other by compensating for each other’s weaknesses”.

How to do triangulation in practice? The following checklist helps to understand the requirements for triangulation:

- The approaches chosen to the study must be able to address the same underlying question. For example, users’ beliefs about interaction can be studied with interviews, surveys, and possibly observations, but may not be – easily at least – studied via log analysis.

- For each approach, the inherent biases should be analyzed and made explicit. Every method has tendencies to focus attention to particular facets of the world, ignoring others; thus, bias. Being aware of such observational biases, we can better select methods that complement each other.

- Mechanisms that produce bias should be understood and acknowledged. For example, researchers have a tendency to use terminology for interviews and surveys that is better approachable by user groups that are similar to them. Each of the methods we discuss in this Part is susceptible to biases, which can be mitigated via careful triangulation. 

- Critical shortcomings or biases should be compensated for somehow, for example, by adding a method that compensates for them. If, for example, one method is more susceptible to the researcher’s own biases, it should be compensated by adding a method that is less so. 

- The results of two methods are compared and assessed to understand how the methods differ. When reporting the results of a triangulated study, we should be systematically aware of the limitations of the methods that inspired the observations.
## Methodological Quality
#### Validity
Validity concerns whether the conclusions drawn from a study are justified. Threats to validity are anything that could go wrong and threatens the validity of the conclusions drawn. A classic taxonomy of validity covers four types [733]. Internal validity: whether a variable under the control of the researcher, for example, user groups, devices, or tasks, has an effect on observations. Construct validity: if a measurement is supposed to measure something, such as user experience, it actually measures it. Statistical conclusion validity: if the conclusions drawn based on the data are statistically reliable. External validity: do the conclusions hold for other participants and settings?
#### Reliability
The reliability of user research and empirical research in general concerns that user research gives consistent results. That is, we would like our methods or measures to give the same result, for instance, if they are applied immediately again to the same person. McDonald et al. [514] offered guidelines on how to assess and use reliability in HCI research.
#### Transparency
The transparency of user research refers to the idea that researchers should make the design, data, analysis approach, and derivation of conclusions accessible and inspectable. However, current practice in HCI is not transparent, and many studies do not share artifacts, protocols for research methods, and so on [837]. There are several practices associated with transparency, such as sharing data, deciding on plans before seeing data; care in analysis and reporting, and maintaining a chain of evidence throughout the study
#### Ethics
Doing user research requires that the person doing the research carefully considers what is right and wrong in collecting, analyzing, and reporting data. 
## Data Analysis and Representation
Validity, reliability, and transparency are all key issues for analysis and frequently ethics becomes relevant in analysis as well. For instance, the transcription of interviews impacts the reliability of the analysis.

Scenarios are narrative accounts of what happens when users are trying to use a system to achieve their goals. Artefact and context models are descriptions of key objects and their contextual relationships within a situation. Quotes are rich representations of users’ attitudes and needs. Finally, journey maps are temporal accounts of encounters that users have with a system.
## Summary
• You are not the user: empirical research is required to obtain knowledge on the practices and experiences of other people. 

• User research uses empirical methods to understand users, their activities, the contexts in which they act, and the interactive systems they presently use, if any. 

• The goal of user research is to produce actionable knowledge about users; insights that may subsequently help design an interactive system or make a decision about its use. 

• All methods for user research are limited, for instance, with respect to their realism, generalizability, and precision.

# 15 Representations of User Research
## Representations of People
### Personas
A persona is the description of an idealized (non-existing) person that represents a group or type of users. The term was popularized by Cooper et al. [166], and has since been widely used in HCI. The idea is to construct archetypes of users in the form of fictional (but representative) individuals with specific characteristics. Personas, however, are based on user research

persona taken from Nielsen:
Camilla and Jesper live on the outskirts of Copenhagen. They are 35 and 39 respectively, and they have enough on their plate with children and careers. They have lived together for the past five years. Two years ago, they had their son Storm. Jesper has two children from his previous marriage, Christian and...
### Creating Personas
Group participants in data by their role. For example: parents, students, managers, and administrators are examples of roles.

try to identify behavioral variables, such as those describing attitudes, skills, beliefs, motivations, and aptitudes. Those variables capture some aspects of why people did what they did. They may be continuous (e.g., ”motivated by social connections [weak-strong]” or ”excited about a new product feature [weak-strong]”), others will be binary (e.g., ”uses Windows 11 [yes/no]”)

Map observational data about participants to behavioral variables. That is, take snippets of data (e.g., interview quotes) and associate them with behavioral variables, for example using post-it notes.

Identify significant clusters forming around behavioral variables.

find clusters where a certain role has a particular behavioral variable strongly represented

Select a persona type and name it.

Verbally explain key attributes and behaviors rooted on the clusters

### Drawbacks of personas
The persona method is often haphazardly applied. From a statistical perspective, a persona is a summary statistic analogous to a mean, median, or mode in some distribution. However, it is not always applied from this perspective; the questions of (1) how to cluster users and (2) select such persons to represent whole groups are dismissed. The consequence is that personas can be almost anything and the connection to original data can be broken

Personas have a relationship to user groups. User groups are segments of user population. Personas are often thought to represent groups or segments. However, defining a user group is tricky.
## Representations of Activities
difficult it is to obtain valid and reliable insights about the activities in which people participate.  

An activity is the total of what a user or a group of users wishes to achieve. It is purposeful interactions among actors that develop over time.

A task is some piece of work to be done.

As an analytic tool in thinking about user research, tasks have several characteristics: 
1. A description of a task is often about things to be done, not about how they are done. When represented like this, tasks can be compared across different interactive systems. Part IV will explain why this is a slightly simplified picture by arguing that tasks and tools are always intertwined. 
2. A description of a task can alternatively be a description of how things are done. Hierarchical task analysis, as we learn here, offers a decomposition of a task (when carried out with a particular tool). 
3. A description of a task should be as specific and concrete as possible. 4. A task is a meaningful unit. That is, getting a task done is a meaningful achievement for the user. They care about being able to complete the task.
### Customer Journey
Customer journey mapping is an account of events where a user encounters a service or product. This map is presented in the form of a journey, or a path that goes via touchpoints.

Rosenbaum et al. [684] describe a method for customer journey maps. It calls for analysis of two dimensions: 
1. Touchpoints: the sequence of events through which customers interact with a service 
2. Relevant strategic actions associated with touchpoints

Touchpoints are typically divided into three periods: pre-service, service, and postservice. 

The pre-service is about experience before registering or purchasing the service. For example, one may encounter advertisements of the service, or hear from friends about it. 

The post-service period takes place after the actual service, for example when posting to social media about the experience or complaining about service to customer service.

## Requirements

## Can Representations be Both Valid and Informative?

## Summary
• Representations of user research serve to capture and reflect upon findings and help prepare for design. 
• They summarize basic aspects of user data: users, events, tasks, activities, and contexts.

• Representations should be traceable and verifiable.
