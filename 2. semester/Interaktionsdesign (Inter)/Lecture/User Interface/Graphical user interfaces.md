What are Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)? 
- Pioneering idea to refer to objects by their location, rather than by their name
- Benefits of metaphors (e.g., trash cans) 
- Studies have shown that GUIs are more useful than command line interfaces
- It is stuff you can see on a screen and touch

How do errors occur? 
- Noise in human neuromuscular system 
- Lack of attention, training, or misunderstanding 
- Confusing design
→ Preempting Errors: 
	design GUI according to basic design principles, such that errors don’t occur in the first place
→ Reversing outcomes: 
	allow users to reverse the results like undo, redo
→ Explaining outcomes and confirming actions:
	for example, seek confirmation when the user desires to issue irreversible commands

Appears easy, but is hard!
- We need a design process 
- Requires empirical understanding of users
- Design is iterative

Visual Organization: 
- Visual hierarchy 
- Visual guidance

The GUI is a fundamentally outstanding idea!
Using space to structure information helps see what one can do and aids memory 
Direct manipulation has made trial and error available to most users in a way where they can back up
