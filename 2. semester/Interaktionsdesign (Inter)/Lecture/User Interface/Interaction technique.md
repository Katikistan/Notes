Man kan lave mange shortcuts, men det er nødvendigvis ikke smart da det tager brugere tid at lære dem og hvis der er for mange bliver det bøvlet

To enable interaction in circumstances that would normally be challenging or impossible

Midas effect: we cannot not use our eyes to look at something; refers to involuntarily selecting things.

Research on interaction techniques involves three main types of efforts: 
1. Innovation of novel input-output couplings (Concept) 
2. Engineering work to enable, implement, and optimize technologies (Design) 
3. Empirical research on how interaction techniques work in practice (Evaluation)

Research involves: 
- Computer science: e.g., machine learning for inferring what users intend 
- Electrical engineering: e.g., sensing methods 
- Interaction design: e.g., designing gestures for smartphone interaction 
- Psychology: e.g., perception

DOF = dimentions of freedom
1 DOF: scrolling, 2 DOF: mouse input, 3 DOF: virtual reality pointing
Two classes of pointing: 
1. Input transfer functions: techniques that map changes in input signal to cursor movement 
2. Display transfer functions: techniques that change the presentation of potential targets to facilitate their selection

Text entry techniques: 
- Use computational methods to facilitate the task of entering text 
- The baseline are physical keyboards
- Much research focuses on virtual keyboards

- Completing phrases: 
	- Auto-correction: ML-based decoder infers what user may have intended to type 
	- Word completion: predictive algorithm tries to predict the next characters given what is typed so far

Text entry techniques: 
- Text editing: find, replace, copy, paste, edit

Camera control 
- There is often more to see than can fit on a display 
- Techniques for camera control help to change what is shown on the display 
- Panning: moves point-of-view across the space (e.g., scroll bar) 
- Zooming: changes magnification of the information

- OrthoZoom: an interaction technique that combines scrolling a 1D data structure with a possibility to zoom by moving the mouse in the dimension orthogonal to the scroll bar 
- OrthoZoom shows a trade-off between panning and zooming

- Particular challenge: 3D 
- 3D navigation has three degrees of freedom: pitch, yaw, roll 
- Interaction techniques affect how users build up an understanding of a spatial environment
