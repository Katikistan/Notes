How to name things?
- Labels that users are familiar with (e.g., desktop) 
- Specific names are better than generic ones (e.g., “insert” instead of “add”) 
- Better if names are meaningful than purely designating a command by convention or through a symbol (e.g., “change ‘KO’, to ‘OK’” better than “RS: |KO|, |OK|”)

When are they useful?
- They can be efficient when the user can take time to learn
- Used for professional applications where skill development or training can be expected (e.g., system administration)

Why is this good? 
- A finite set of options
- Visual and textual presentation 
- Interactive exposition of options 
- Transience: expanded in place and dismissed after use 
- Multimodality: alternative ways to interact with menus can be offered
