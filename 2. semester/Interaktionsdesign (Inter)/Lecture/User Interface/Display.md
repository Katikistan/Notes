- Visual displays (e.g., computer screen) 
- Haptic devices (e.g., displays that you can feel)
- Any device that can render information in a modality that humans can perceive

- Central idea: transform digital information into analog information that people can accurately perceive in one or more sensory modalities. 
- A display needs to communicate digital information that matches what humans can perceive 
	- For example, In terms of resolution 
	- Should be available in unbiased and complete

Virtual Reality 
	- Can completely immerse the user within a virtual world 
	- tracks the user’s head movements to show a new part of the virtual world when turning their head 
	- Current HMDs cannot display the world exactly how we perceive it, thus there is a mismatch (e.g., simulator sickness)
	- VR HMDs also need positional tracking, such that users can walk in VR

Augmented Reality 
	- Inserts virtual information into the user’s view of the real environment 
	- Popular through mobile phones, but is also used in headsets 
	- Can be video or optical see-through'

Audio 
	- Stereo and surround sound: 
		- Humans can infer the direction and distance of an origin of a sound
		- Interaural time difference to enable sound localization
		- Monaural systems either emit sound signals to a single speaker or emit the same sound signal to speakers 
		- Stereophonic systems reproduce sound localization to various extent by emitting different sound signals to different speakers
