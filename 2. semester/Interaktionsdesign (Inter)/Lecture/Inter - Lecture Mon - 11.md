# User interfaces
## Summary of user interfaces
- User interfaces are what the user comes into contact with when using an interactive system.  

- User interfaces comprise input devices, displays, interaction techniques, representations, and substrates.  

- The design of user interfaces faces a tradeoff between different, conflicting criteria.
## Which parts does a user interface consist of?
**Devices:**  
- Input Devices: used by the user to control an interface  
- Output Devices: allow the system to provide information and feedback to the user  
**Interaction Techniques:**  
	Interaction techniques translate  inputs from input devices, and  possibly context sensors, into  changes in the rest of the user  interface
**Representations:**  
	Determine how data, events, objects, and actions appear to the user  
**Organization:**  
	Any set of design principles followed to link the data environment to input, output, sensing, interaction techniques, and representations
## How to design a user interface?
Design Objectives:  
- Usability  
- Accessibility  
- Efficiency and Performance  
- Learnability:  
Easy to learn, proficiency, discoverability  
and explorability, consistency

# Input devices
A system needs to be capable of sensing a user’s movements or states and  
turning them into information in the interactive system

That information may be used to trigger a command or input a value, enabling  
users to interact

Input devices allow users to provide information into a computer system.  

Design factors for input devices include their temporal and spatial resolutions,  
accuracy, sensing modality, sensing interaction potential, sensing validity, integrality  
and separability, and accessibility.  

Input devices span a wide range but can be roughly divided into  
- key-based devices  
- direct and indirect pointing devices, and  
- uncertain control devices.  
- Input devices provide different opportunities and challenges for design, and thus some are more suitable for particular interaction context than others.

Uncertain control betyder bare at der ikke er lavet research på hvordan mennesker interagere med devicet. 
 - Eye tracking
 - Fingertracking
 - Electromyography 
 - Microphone Input and Speech Recognition

Expanding the Limits of Sensing
- Input devices started as simple switches 
- Then input devices began to be used for sensing movement: the mouse 
- Non-command interfaces: infer users’ intentions through precise sensing and dispense the need for a user to explicitly issue a command

# Output Devices/Displays
- Visual displays (e.g., computer  screen)  
- Haptic devices (e.g., displays that you can feel)  
- Any device that can render information in a modality that humans can perceive

Central idea: transform digital information into analog information that people can accurately perceive in one or more sensory modalities.  
A display needs to communicate digital information that matches what humans can perceive  
- For example, In terms of resolution  
- Should be available in unbiased and complete ways
## Summary of Output Devices/Displays
Displays turn digital information into physical phenomena that users should be able to perceive accurately  

A key consideration is their match to the human visual system. Any change in a display, be it visual or otherwise, may not be perceived or perceived proportionally by the user.
# GUI
What are Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)? 
- Pioneering idea to refer to objects by their location, rather than by their name
- Benefits of metaphors (e.g., trash cans) 
- Studies have shown that GUIs are more useful than command line interfaces
- It is stuff you can see on a screen and touch

How do errors occur? 
- Noise in human neuromuscular system 
- Lack of attention, training, or misunderstanding 
- Confusing design
→ Preempting Errors: 
	design GUI according to basic design principles, such that errors don’t occur in the first place
→ Reversing outcomes: 
	allow users to reverse the results like undo, redo
→ Explaining outcomes and confirming actions:
	for example, seek confirmation when the user desires to issue irreversible commands

Appears easy, but is hard!
- We need a design process 
- Requires empirical understanding of users
- Design is iterative

Visual Organization: 
- Visual hierarchy 
- Visual guidance

The GUI is a fundamentally outstanding idea!
Using space to structure information helps see what one can do and aids memory 
Direct manipulation has made trial and error available to most users in a way where they can back up

Virtual Reality 
	- Can completely immerse the user within a virtual world 
	- tracks the user’s head movements to show a new part of the virtual world when turning their head 
	- Current HMDs cannot display the world exactly how we perceive it, thus there is a mismatch (e.g., simulator sickness)
	- VR HMDs also need positional tracking, such that users can walk in VR

Augmented Reality 
	- Inserts virtual information into the user’s view of the real environment 
	- Popular through mobile phones, but is also used in headsets 
	- Can be video or optical see-through'

Audio 
	- Stereo and surround sound: 
		- Humans can infer the direction and distance of an origin of a sound
		- Interaural time difference to enable sound localization
		- Monaural systems either emit sound signals to a single speaker or emit the same sound signal to speakers 
		- Stereophonic systems reproduce sound localization to various extent by emitting different sound signals to different speakers
