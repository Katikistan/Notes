Summary: "Fitts law"
---
Fitts lov:

- Fitts’ law is a mathematical model that predicts that the average movement time required to hit a target along a one-dimensional path is proportional to the difficulty of hitting a target. This “difficulty’ involves the distance to the target and the width of the target
	- Den er udledt vha ekspermentation.
```math
||{"id":159402039833}||

MT = a + bID
```
where a and b are regression coefficients and ID is known as the Index of Difficulty. The Index of Difficulty is an encoding of how far away the target is and how large it is and and it is defined as:
```math
||{"id":709887695761}||
I D=\log _2(\frac{D+W}{W})=\log _2(\frac{D}{W}+1)
```
where D is the distance to the target and W is the width to the target.
The closer the target is, the lower D is and hence the lower the Index of Difficulty. Similarly, the larger the target is, the larger W is and the lower the Index of Difficulty


- Movement constraints
	 - Spatially constrained aimed movements are restricted at the end or during the movement to a specified region or point. Discrete aimed movements are movements to spatially bounded targets.
	 - Temporally constrained aimed movements must hit a target defined in time. The target can be hit during a specific interval, or the goal is to be as close to the target as possible.

- Simple and Choice Reactions
	- Simple reaction is another fundamental motor action in HCI: Something appears on the display or in the environment, and the user must respond to it as quickly as possible.
	- Choice reaction generalizes this to the case where more than one response option is available

- Hick–Hyman Law
	- Den siger at der er en sammenhæng mellem responstid og antal muligheder i et valg.
	- n + 1 hvis det er en mulighed at lade vær med at svare
