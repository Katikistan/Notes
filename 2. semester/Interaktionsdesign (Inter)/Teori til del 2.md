You are not the user: empirical research is required to obtain knowledge on the practices and experiences of other people
“If transcription is sloppy, the resulting analysis may suffer. Similarly, the care by which we record observations of users might impact the validity of our findings; if we miss writing down certain observations, our data might be invalid”

One key question in interviewing is how to structure the interview. There are many forms of interviews that have been developed for a range of different purposes in many research fields. 

At a high-level these forms of interview can be divided into structured, semistructured, and unstructured interviews

s. While there are various ways to conduct structured interviews, in this chapter we will focus on an important type of structured interview in HCI called contextual inquiry. 

Unstructured interviews are an important research methodology in some fields, such as sociology, however, they are not that common in HCI and will not be treated in detail in this chapter

Semi-structured interviews tend to follow a loose structure and are frequently referred to as open-ended interviews in HCI. Open-ended interviews will be treated in detail in this chapter.

Open-Ended Interviews 

They are called open-ended because the questions asked during the interview are not fully planned in advance and, at least in part, developed and adapted depending on their answers.

The interview is flexible in content and structure, just as a conversation may freely develop. Thus, the interviewer adapts their questions based on what is being said. They follow up on answers and may pursue new information with additional questions.

They follow up on answers and may pursue new information with additional questions.

The basis of any interview is the development of the themes of the interview. The themes concern what topics the interviewer wants to learn about

They may focus on a specific system, event, or use situation—or they may be broad and cover the totality of the interviewee’s life

In open-ended interviewing, you want to ask simple questions that allows interviewees to give complex answers. Three types of questions may be distinguished: main questions, probes, and follow-up questions. Main questions directly corresponds to the themes of the interview; typically, there are a few of these questions for any study. Main questions are often broad and allow the interviewee to cover the basis.

In a grounded question, interviewers are instead asked to explain a specific example that grounds their answer

The second type of question, probes, is designed to make the interviewee comfortable and continue to talk. Thus, such questions have no explicit link to the themes of a study but are simply tactics for moving the conversation forward, asking for elaboration and clarification, or for coming back to the indented point of a main question after a digression. For instance, the interviewer may say ”mmhmm”, ”then what...”, ”please go on”, ”what hapened next?”, or ”tell me more about that”

follow-up questions, aims to further extend the answer to a main question. The intent is to ensure that the conversation of a main question is thorough and deep, and to explore new ideas and concepts that the interviewee brings up. Some of those questions can be worked out in advance, in anticipation of likely answers. They may also be improvised during an interview, when new information or interesting stories are shared

  

Clarify answers. Follow up on undefined terms or unclear explanations. For instance, ”you said that the system was X; what do you mean by X?” or ”what you said there seemed very important and I want to be sure that I understand it; please explain it again”.

Getting answers concrete. Follow up on answers that oversimplify, lack depth, or are abstract. For instance, ”could you give me an example?”.

Compare or contrast answers. You may follow up on the answers by asking the interviewee to compare or contrast them to previous answers. For instance, ”you said earlier that X; how does that situation to compare to what you just told me”. • Understanding variations. Here you follow up to understand how responses vary over circumstances. For instance, ”do you always do it this way?” or ”how has this changed over time?”. • Ensure thoroughness. You may follow up when answers does not cover all aspects of a main question or when you feel that information is missing. For instance, ”I think we have not covered X much; please tell me about that”. • Personal attitude. Follow up on questions where it is unclear how the interviewee thought or felt. For instance, ”why was this important to you” or "how did you feel about that”

Avoid wording that could influence the answers in a particular direction, biasing the questions, or giving cues to their answer. For instance, instead of asking ”How much did like the system?” – highly biasing, you can ask ”Can you tell me about your experiences while using the system?” 

Questions should be asked one at a time; avoid the dreaded double-barrelled question (e.g., ”Let me know how you normally do the same task when at home and what kinds of features you use in your toaster.”)

A key issue is to avoid leading questions. A leading question is a question that implies that there is a specific set of “right” answers to a question.

An interview conversation consists of a number of parts

Introduction

introduce themselves and the interviewer explains the purpose of the interview

Warm-up, make the participant step away from their regular life and change their focus to consider the objective of the interview. This part typically includes some easy questions to start the conversation and make the interviewee comfortable. - det var hjulpet på vej at vi gjorde det imens de var i centeret

General issues : In the third phase, the interview is centered around direct experiences and related attitudes and expectations with the product, system or service

Deep focus: the central HCI idea or system is introduced and the interview concentrates around the details of what this HCI idea or system entails, what it does, how it works, whether the interviewee can use it, and what the immediate experience or reaction is to this HCI idea. This part is the key part of the interview, where the main questions are asked, prompts are given, and follow-up questions are used to deepen the interview.

Retrospective: This is also an opportunity for the interviewee to relate the general issues identified earlier with thoughts that arose in the deep focus phase.

Wrap-up: It includes thanking the interviewee for their time and answers. what will happen next, for instance, if they expect to send the whole or parts of the interview, or the analysis of the interviewee, to the interviewee for comments or approval.

Contextual inquiry is a type of interview developed for the purposes of HCI by Holtzblatt and Beyer s. 246. it can be considered a mixed-methods approach to interviewing.

The key idea in contextual inquiries is to watch users do activities that are important to then and talk to them about those activities

Inquiry is guided by four principles:

Context

Partnership

Interpretation 

Focus
