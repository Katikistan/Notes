# User interfaces
## Summary of user interfaces
- User interfaces are what the user comes into contact with when using an interactive system.  

- User interfaces comprise input devices, displays, interaction techniques, representations, and substrates.  

- The design of user interfaces faces a tradeoff between different, conflicting criteria.
## Which parts does a user interface consist of?
**Devices:**  
- Input Devices: used by the user to control an interface  
- Output Devices: allow the system to provide information and feedback to the user  
**Interaction Techniques:**  
	Interaction techniques translate  inputs from input devices, and  possibly context sensors, into  changes in the rest of the user  interface
**Representations:**  
	Determine how data, events, objects, and actions appear to the user  
**Organization:**  
	Any set of design principles followed to link the data environment to input, output, sensing, interaction techniques, and representations
## How to design a user interface?
Design Objectives:  
- Usability  
- Accessibility  
- Efficiency and Performance  
- Learnability:  
Easy to learn, proficiency, discoverability  
and explorability, consistency

# Input devices
A system needs to be capable of sensing a userâ€™s movements or states and  
turning them into information in the interactive system

That information may be used to trigger a command or input a value, enabling  
users to interact

Input devices allow users to provide information into a computer system.  

Design factors for input devices include their temporal and spatial resolutions,  
accuracy, sensing modality, sensing interaction potential, sensing validity, integrality  
and separability, and accessibility.  

Input devices span a wide range but can be roughly divided into  
- key-based devices  
- direct and indirect pointing devices, and  
- uncertain control devices.  
- Input devices provide different opportunities and challenges for design, and thus some are more suitable for particular interaction context than others.
# Output Devices/Displays
- Visual displays (e.g., computer  screen)  
- Haptic devices (e.g., displays that you can feel)  
- Any device that can render information in a modality that humans can perceive

Central idea: transform digital information into analog information that people can accurately perceive in one or more sensory modalities.  
A display needs to communicate digital information that matches what humans can perceive  
- For example, In terms of resolution  
- Should be available in unbiased and complete ways
## Summary of Output Devices/Displays
Displays turn digital information into physical phenomena that users should be able to perceive accurately  

A key consideration is their match to the human visual system. Any change in a display, be it visual or otherwise, may not be perceived or perceived proportionally by the user.
