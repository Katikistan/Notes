# Class Adapter pattern
# Object Adapter pattern 
# Decorator pattern 
Decorator pattern  
•A Decorator pattern  
allows the creation of heterogeneous stack structures.  
•Approach:  
•A stack consists of structurally different elements,  
•the last element without a successor and  
•preceding elements, which have exactly one direct successor.  
•The different elements offer different attributes and different  
behavior.  
•But the attributes and behavior refer with regards to content  
always to all the following elements.  
•Each additional element expands (= decorates) the existing  
elements.  
•The entire stack has the same semantics like its second element.  
•Requirement:  
All elements must offer the same interface to the outside.
