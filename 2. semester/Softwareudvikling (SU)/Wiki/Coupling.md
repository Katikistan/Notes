# Coupling
In software development, "coupling" refers to the degree to which different components of a software system depend on each other. It describes the extent to which changes to one component affect other components of the system.

In general, low coupling is desirable because it leads to more modular and flexible software that is easier to maintain and modify. High coupling, on the other hand, can lead to tightly-coupled and brittle code that is difficult to change without causing unintended consequences.

There are several types of coupling, including:

1.  **Content coupling:** This occurs when one component modifies or relies on the internal workings of another component.
2.  **Common coupling:** This occurs when multiple components depend on the same global data or state.
3.  **Control coupling:** This occurs when one component controls the flow of another component.
4.  **Stamp coupling:** This occurs when components pass large amounts of data between each other.    
5.  **Data coupling:** This occurs when components only pass necessary data between each other.

Reducing coupling in software systems is an important principle in software design and architecture, as it leads to more maintainable, extensible, and testable code.
