# 1.2 Monte Carlo & Las Vegas
Ways to classify randomized algoritms 
# Monte Carlo
Some probability of error. Running time may be  
random or not.  
**Two-sided error:** non-zero probability of failure  
when it outputs either true or false  

**One-sided error:** probability of failure is 0 for at  
least one of the two possible outputs (true/false)

# Las Vegas
Always returns correct answer. 

Running time is a  random variable.

A Las Vegas algorithm is by definition a Monte Carlo algorithm with error probability 0.
