##### Weekly note
[[Uge 7 - 2024]]

**Divide** the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller
instances of the same problem.

**Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively.

**Combine** the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the originalproblem.
# [[Merge sort]]
The recursion reaches the base case when the subarray A[p : r] to be sorted has just 1 element: when p equals r. As noted for loop invariants, a subarray comprising just a single element is always sorted.
# Analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms
When an algorithm contains a recursive call, you can often describe its running time by a [[Recurrences|recurrence]].
