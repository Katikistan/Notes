Here order matters therefore 1,2 and 2,1 are not the same.

curly brackets common for sets.

n permute r =  $_nP_r$
$_nP_n=n!=n \cdot(n-1)\cdot (n-2) ... 2 \cdot 1$
$0!=1$

 $_nP_r$ = (# of ways to do T_1) * (# of ways to do task 2)
  (# of ways to do T_1) = x
$x=\frac{_nP_r}{r!}=x$
r! = (# of ways to do task 2)

mulisets: subset with repeats, maybe the same as the cartesian product

collary:  (# of n-bit strings containing exactly k ones) = (# of subsets of size-k chosen from an n-element set)
 


(#size r multisets of A) = (# m bit strings) with exactly r  = n+r-1Cr by collary 1
