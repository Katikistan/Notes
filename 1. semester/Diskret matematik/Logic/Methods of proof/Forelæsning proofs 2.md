Bevis at det er et lige tal: n+(n+2) 
et tal der der et multiple a 2 er lige
n+(n+2) = 2n+2 =2(n+1)
man har vist at n+(n+2) er lige 


Direct proof:
OBS: man ville sige i definition at det er positive integers og naturlige numre.

Case 1:
assume n | a, then a = cn where $c \in Z$ .

Then ab = (cn)*b=n(cb)
since cb is an integer we that n|ab
QED: no beacuse we are missing the second case therefore the prove is not done yet.

assume n | b do something similar as in case 1.

now we have prove the contrapositive so we have proven:

Why prove when we have an or: we need that at least one of the statment have to be true, but we could have that a dosent divide n therefore we need to examine all statments to find at least one that holds true.
