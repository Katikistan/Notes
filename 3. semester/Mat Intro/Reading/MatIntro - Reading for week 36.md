# Sets and intervals
## Sets
A *set* is a collection of *elements*. For example, the set containing the *elements* $-1$, $0$, and 1 is written as:

$$
\{-1,0,1\}
$$

The set of *natural numbers* is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$

The *whole numbers* are defined as:

$$
\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$

The general notation for sets is written as:

$$
\{\cdots\}
$$

## Intervals
We can represent the *set* of*real numbers* $\mathbb{R}$ with a *number line*:

If we want to visualise a section of the real numbers, we can colour a part of the number line:
![[Pasted image 20230821135158.png]]
In this illustration, the coloured part is the *interval* of our set consisting of all numbers smaller or equal to 2. The following notation can also be used:
$$
\text { ] }-\infty ; 2] .
$$
Here are various *intervals* represented with different notation:

$[a;b]$ is equivalent to $a \leq x \leq b$

$]a;b[$ is equivalent to $a < x < b$

$[a;b[$ is equivalent to $a \leq x < b$

$]a;b]$ is equivalent to $a<x\leq b$
![[Pasted image 20230821135635.png]]

$]a;\infty[$ is equivalent to $a<x$
![[Pasted image 20230821135710.png]]

$[a;\infty[$ is equivalent to $a\leq x$
![[Pasted image 20230821135719.png]]

$]-\infty;b[$ is equivalent to $x< b$
![[Pasted image 20230821135750.png]]

$]-\infty; b]$ is equivalent to  $x\leq b$

# Functions
![[4. Functions]]

Let $A,B$ be sets. A *function* from A to B is an expression or rule that "assigns" every $x\in A$ to a value $f(x)\in B$ 

$$f:A\rightarrow B$$
$A$ is the domain
$B$ is the codomain

**Example**: $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ applies to$f(x)=x^2$

**Definition**: A *function* $f:A\rightarrow B$ is *injective* if:
$$x,y\in A, f(x)=f(y)\leftrightarrow x=y$$
**Definition**: A *function* $f:A\rightarrow B$ is *surjective* if: 
$$\forall y\in B~\exists x\in A : f(x)=y$$
**Definition**:  A *function* $f:A\rightarrow B$ is *bijective* if it is both *injective* and *surjective*.

**Examples**
$f_1:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$
$f_1(x)=x^2$ is injective and surjective, and thus bijective

$f_2:[-1,1]\rightarrow[-1,1]$
$f_2(x)=x^2$ is not injective since $f_2(-\frac{1}{2})=f_2(\frac{1}{2})$ and not surjective since $f_2(x)=-\frac{1}{2}$ has no solutions.

## Real numbers

**Definition (supremum property)**: 
Let $S$ be a non-empty set of *real numbers*.

- A real number $x$ is called an *upper bound* for $S$ if $x \geq s \forall s \in S$.
- A real number $x$ is the *supremum* for $S$ if $x$ is an *upper bound* for $S$ and $x \leq y$ for every *upper bound* $y$ of $S$.

The **supremum property** states that any non-empty set of real numbers that has an *upper bound* must have a **supremum** in _real numbers_.
### Example
$\operatorname{sup} \{\frac{1}{n^2} \mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}=1$
$\operatorname{sup} \{-\frac{1}{n} \mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}=0$
