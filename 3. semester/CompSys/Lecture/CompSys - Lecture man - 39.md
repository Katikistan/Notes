```ad-tip
title: Definition of cache
A smaller, faster storage device that acts as a staging area for a subset of the data in a larger, slower device.

```

Fundamental idea of the memory hierarchy 
- The smaller and faster device at level k acts as a cache for the larger slower device at level k + 1.
Why do they work?
	Because of locality, most accesses tend to be towards the top of the hierarchy.
