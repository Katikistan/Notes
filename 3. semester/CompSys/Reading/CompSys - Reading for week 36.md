title: Compiler
A program that translates high-level language statements into assembly language statements.

```
**Assembly language:** A symbolic representation of machine instructions.

**Machine language:** A binary representation of machine instructions.

**cache memory:** A small, fast memory that acts as a buffer for a slower, larger memory.

**Static Random Access Memory (SRAM):** Also memory built as an integrated circuit, but faster and less dense than DRAM.

**volatile memory:** Storage, such as DRAM, that retains data only if it is receiving power. 

**nonvolatile memory:** A form of memory that retains data even in the absence of a power source and that is used to store programs between runs. A DVD disk is nonvolatile.

**local area network (LAN):** A network designed to carry data within a geographically confined area, typically within a single building. 

**wide area network (WAN):** A network extended over hundreds of kilometers that can span a continent.
