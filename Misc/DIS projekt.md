You design and build a web-app around a publicly available dataset

Python + Flask + PostgreSQL

## Documentation
• Your database model (E/R diagram)
• How to compile your web-app from source (incl. scripts to initialize the database)?
• How to run and interact with your web-app?
## The web-app
• Should interact with the database via SQL (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT statements)
• Should perform regular expression matching or context free grammar parsing
• Bonus points for use of views, triggers, stored procedures, but not required

## Minimal amount of effort to pass the project:
Start from the bank web-app (understand its code-base)
• Mildly modify the interface: e.g., to an insurance web-app
• Modify the database and the interaction accordingly
• Make it look like your own project
• Do not forget to add a regex match somewhere!
